 The Board of Trustees of First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund (the &quot;Fund&quot;) (NYSE: FDEU), CUSIP 33740D107, previously approved a managed distribution policy for the Fund (the &quot;Managed Distribution Plan&quot;) in reliance on exemptive relief received from the Securities and Exchange Commission which permits the Fund to make periodic distributions of long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly each tax year. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fund has declared a distribution payable on January 15, 2020, to shareholders of record as of January 3, 2020, with an ex-dividend date of January 2, 2020. This Notice is meant to provide you information about the sources of your Fund's distributions. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of its distribution or from the terms of its Managed Distribution Plan. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date for the Fund from the following sources: net investment income (&quot;NII&quot;); net realized short-term capital gains (&quot;STCG&quot;); net realized long-term capital gains (&quot;LTCG&quot;); and return of capital (&quot;ROC&quot;). These estimates are based upon information as of December 31, 2019, are calculated based on a generally accepted accounting principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;) basis and include the prior fiscal year-end undistributed net investment income. The amounts and sources of distributions are expressed per common share. </P><PRE>

 (1) Includes the most recent monthly distribution paid on January 15, 2020. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with &quot;yield&quot; or &quot;income.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Based on Net Asset Value (&quot;NAV&quot;) as of December 31, 2019. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Total Returns are through December 31, 2019. The return included in the 5 Year Average Annual Total Return on NAV column is from the Fund's first public offering, which was September 24, 2015. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. You should not use this Notice as a substitute for your Form 1099-DIV. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; First Trust Advisors L.P. (&quot;FTA&quot;) is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (&quot;FTP&quot;), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $145 billion as of December 31, 2019 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Janus Capital Management LLC, a legal entity of Janus Henderson Investors, serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor. Janus Henderson Investors is headquartered in London and is a global investment management firm that provides a full spectrum of investment products and services to clients around the world. With offices in 28 cities with more than 2,000 employees, Janus Henderson Investors managed approximately $356.1 billion in assets as of September 30, 2019. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Principal Risk Factors: The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the Fund will invest primarily in securities of non-U.S. issuers, which are generally denominated in non-U.S. currencies, there are risks not typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. Non-U.S. issuers are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. An investor may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted via referendum to leave the EU (&quot;Brexit&quot;), which led to volatility in the financial markets of the United Kingdom and more broadly across Europe as well as weakening consumer, corporate and financial confidence in such markets. The deadline for which terms of exit may be negotiated between the United Kingdom and the EU has been extended to January 31, 2020 (subject to further extension). The longer term economic, legal, political and social framework in the United Kingdom is unclear at this stage and is likely to lead to ongoing political, economic and legal uncertainty and periods of exacerbated volatility in both the United Kingdom and in wider European markets for some time. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fund will engage in practices and strategies that will result in exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, thus subjecting it to foreign currency risk. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fund's use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used, may require the Fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the Fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of conversion to an open-end management investment company, the Common Shares would cease to be listed on the NYSE or other national securities exchange, and such Common Shares would thereafter be redeemable at NAV at the option of the Common Shareholder, rather than traded in the secondary market at market price, which, for closed-end fund shares, may at times be at a premium to NAV. Any Borrowings or Preferred Shares of the Fund would need to be repaid or redeemed upon conversion and, accordingly, a portion of the Fund's portfolio may need to be liquidated, potentially resulting in, among other things, lower current income. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; January 15, 2020 16:16 ET (21:16 GMT)- - 04 16 PM EST 01-15-20</P>"

The firm was formed in 2012 and is based in New York City. ICA seeks total-return opportunities in key infrastructure sectors, including energy, real estate, transportation, industrials and utilities. It often identifies opportunities in entities that are not taxed at the entity level, such as master limited partnerships (&quot;MLPs&quot;) and real estate investment trusts (&quot;REITs&quot;).

For more information, please visit www.infracapfunds.com. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; DISCLOSURE </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fund Risks </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF): The value of an ETF may be more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities it is designed to track. The costs of owning the ETF may exceed the cost of investing directly in the underlying securities. Preferred Stocks: Preferred stocks may decline in price, fail to pay dividends, or be illiquid. Real Estate Investments: The fund may be negatively affected by factors specific to the real estate market, including interest rates, leverage, property, and management. Industry/Sector Concentration: A fund that focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector will be more sensitive to conditions that affect that industry or sector than a non-concentrated fund. Passive Strategy/Index Risk: A passive investment strategy seeking to track the performance of the underlying index may result in the fund holding securities regardless of market conditions or their current or projected performance. This could cause the fund's returns to be lower than if the fund employed an active strategy. Correlation to Index: The performance of the fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fund flows, transaction costs, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from its index. Market Volatility: Securities in the fund may go up or down in response to the prospects of individual companies and general economic conditions. Price changes may be short or long term. Prospectus: For additional information on risks, please see the fund's prospectus. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing.

"<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest Market Talks covering Equities. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1830 ET [Dow Jones] -- Suncorp's gross written premium growth could be heading for the bottom end of its 2-4% FY guidance range after the insurer refused cover for some bushfire-threatened properties, Macquarie says. Cutting its price target by 1.5% to A$13.00, Macquarie says Suncorp was this month refusing cover for about a quarter of rural properties in NSW state. The investment bank speculates the move relates to bushfire risks and could extend into neighboring Victoria in February. Macquarie trimmed its EPS forecast 0.7% for FY 2020, and by 5.2% for FY 2021. Suncorp shares are down 0.1% at A$13.175. (stuart.condie@wsj.com; @StuartLCondie) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1828 ET - Look to the U.S. for reassurance that Charter Hall Retail REIT's net tangible assets have support, Macquarie says. In the U.S., supermarket-anchored real-estate investment trusts have outperformed the property sector and significantly outperformed owners of regional malls. In Australia, &quot;we have also seen neighborhood and small sub-regional assets trade at premiums to net tangible assets, with high net-worth individuals and syndicators remaining active given the spread between cap rates and term deposits,&quot; says Macquarie. It upgrades Charter Hall Retail REIT to outperform from underperform and raises its price target by 33% to A$5.20/share. Charter Hall Retail REIT is down 0.2% at A$4.62 today. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1820 ET [Dow Jones] -- Stockland has been rebasing expectations for its retail property division, but Citi highlights a risk that this could be a recurring process. That view reflects Stockland's lease structures, which continue to embed unsustainable rent growth. Also, Stockland's occupancy costs remain at historic highs. &quot;We see risk of disappointment in both earnings and capital values, with assumptions in Stockland's retail book values (circa 3% annual growth) looking very optimistic versus historical sales and rent growth,&quot; Citi says. It retains a sell call on the stock. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1820 ET [Dow Jones] -- Potential for earnings upgrades at BHP remains over the medium term, assuming iron-ore prices stay high, bull Macquarie says. A spot price scenario suggests &quot;35% and 50% upside to FY 2021 and FY 2022 earnings, respectively,&quot; Macquarie says. Also, free cash flow yields at spot prices are 10% for FY 2021 and FY 2022. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1814 ET [Dow Jones] -- There is life in the U.S. housing cycle yet, says ANZ. The bank has raised its end-2020 forecast of housing starts to 1.4 million from 1.3 million, pointing to a greater share of lending being directed to home purchases. Residential investment, as a share of GDP, will be close to 4.5% at the end of 2020, compared to 3.7% as of 3Q 2019. Thus housing should be a solid supporter of the economy in 2020, ANZ adds. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1818 ET - China has learnt lessons from SARS, says UBS. The mortality rate of the Wuhan pneumonia seems notably lower than SARS. However, the ongoing travel peak season -- the lunar new year starts Saturday -- is a tremendous challenge, which could complicate the disease diffusion. If the pneumonia couldn't be contained in the short term, expect China's retail sales, tourism, hotel and catering, travel activities likely to be hit, especially in 1Q and early 2Q. UBS' forecast of sequential growth rebound in 1h20 would face some downside risk. Expect PBC to keep interbank liquidity ample and guide down market interest rates, with the help of additional 50 basis point RRR cut. ( james.glynn@wsj.com;@JamesGlynnWSJ) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Australia's bushfires are likely to have affected a Boral cement facility in NSW state and could lead to lower production or margins, UBS says. The bank says the facility in Berrima is likely to have been affected by extended leave for staff and road closures. BHP and Whitehaven have already cited the impact of bushfire smoke on December coal production. Boral shares are 11% higher in 2020 at A$4.99. (stuart.condie@wsj.com; @StuartLCondie) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1757 ET - UBS raises its annual earnings forecast for BHP by 2% to reflect better sales volumes of copper and higher prices for its output. For the miner's 1H, it now forecasts an underlying net profit of US$5.04B, up 25% on year. &quot;BHP has declared half-yearly dividends equating to 70% of underlying EPS over the last six halves,&quot; UBS says. &quot;All else being equal, a 70% payout ratio implies an interim dividend of US$0.69/share.&quot; If it's right then BHP's interim dividend would be 25% higher than the US$0.55/share payout at the corresponding stage of FY19. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1747 ET - Pact's contract manufacturing division could fetch A$120M-A$140M after management said yesterday it would seek a buyer for the business, Morgans says. This estimated price tag would represent an FY20 enterprise value-to-ebitda multiple of 6-7 times. &quot;Given Pact's relatively stretched balance sheet and ongoing suspension of dividends, the proceeds from the divestment will go a long way to improving Pact's financial capacity, Morgans says. Pact's net debt-to-Ebitda metric is seen around 3 times this year, but a sale could bring it down to 2.6 times in FY21. (david.winning@wsj.com; @dwinningWSJ) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1743 ET - Capital One remains all in on its technology transformation, chief Richard Fairbank says on the bank's earnings call. Capital One is on &quot;the home stretch&quot; of its transition to the cloud, he says, and on track to exit its use of data centers. The bank reported $16M in cybersecurity expenses, net of insurance recoveries, in 4Q related to its 2019 data breach of personal information of about 106M card customers and applicants and said expenses tied to the breach are expected to continue this year. The breach involved a hacker breaking through a Capital One firewall to access consumer data that the bank had stored on Amazon's cloud service. (annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1728 ET - Canada stocks fall, with the benchmark S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index declining 0.1% to 17572 and the blue-chip S&amp;P TSX 60 Index off 0.1% to 1047. Air Canada ends 4.5% lower after Boeing said it doesn't expect the 737 MAX to be approved for commercial use until mid 2020 at the earliest. Toy company Spin Master falls 4.9% after the company changed its guidance and said it expects gross product sales to fall about 1% in 2019 and for adjusted Ebitda margin to be about 14%. (allison.prang@wsj.com; @AllisonPrang) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1719 ET - Canadian carrier WestJet will remove the Boeing 737 MAX from its schedule until June 24. WestJet says it made the decision after Boeing said earlier in the day it was pushing back its timetable for regulators to clear the MAX aircraft for commercial service. Boeing now says that may not happen until June or July. WestJet, which has 13 MAX aircraft in its fleet, says it remains confident in the regulatory process.

"Community Bank System Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results <PRE>
SYRACUSE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 22, 2020-- </PRE>

 Community Bank System, Inc. (NYSE: CBU) reported fourth quarter 2019 net income of $42.9 million and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.82. This compares to $40.8 million in net income or $0.78 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018. Fourth quarter 2019 operating earnings per share (non-GAAP), which excludes acquisition expenses and unrealized loss on equity securities, were $0.83, or $0.05 above the fourth quarter of 2018. Full year diluted earnings per share totaled $3.23 in 2019, compared to $3.24 in 2018, and reflect a $0.11 negative impact due to the Durbin debit interchange price restrictions. Full year diluted operating earnings per share (non-GAAP), which excludes acquisition expenses, gain on sale of investments, unrealized gain on equity securities and loss on debt extinguishment, of $3.29 for 2019 were $0.06 per share higher than the $3.23 per share of operating earnings generated in 2018. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2019 Performance Highlights: </P><PRE>

 &quot;Our 2019 very solid fourth quarter was characterized by revenue growth, improved earnings along with a continuation of positive operating metrics compared with the prior year quarter. Moreover, we are pleased with the company's performance throughout 2019, during which we continued to utilize acquisitions to expand and strengthen our service area, organically grew loan and deposit portfolios, increased revenue to nearly $590 million and extended our uninterrupted streak of dividend increases to shareholders,&quot; said Mark E. Tryniski, President and Chief Executive Officer. &quot;Our acquisition of Kinderhook Bank Corp. (&quot;Kinderhook&quot;), during third quarter 2019 extended our market reach into the Capital District of Upstate New York, a region with attractive economic and demographic characteristics. The Company's fourth quarter definitive agreement to acquire Steuben Trust Corporation will provide additional retail strength to our existing Western New York service area along with providing entry into two new Western New York counties. The transaction is also expected to be immediately accretive to earnings. Organic revenue increases in our employee benefits services and insurance services businesses were responsible for higher noninterest revenue in 2019. Total loans at year end increased by more than $600 million, driven by organic growth and by the Kinderhook acquisition. Despite realizing loan growth of nearly 10% in 2019, our asset quality metrics remained strong and consistent and reflective of our disciplined approach to lending. All in all, the accomplishments in 2019 were significant and were reflected in our Board's decision to raise our cash dividend for the 27(th) consecutive year. Our unbroken streak of dividend increases puts Community Bank System in very select company, and signifies our commitment to robust shareholder returns. We begin 2020 well positioned to extend our performance through the year.&quot; <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $149.9 million, an increase of $8.3 million, or 5.8%, over the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company recorded a $5.4 million, or 6.1%, increase in net interest income and a $2.9 million, or 5.4%, increase in noninterest revenues. The increase in net interest income was due largely to a $733.0 million increase in average earning assets between the periods due to both the Kinderhook acquisition and organic growth in earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin. The increase in noninterest revenues was due to a $1.0 million, or 5.8%, increase in deposit and other banking revenues and a $1.9 million, or 5.2%, increase on non-banking noninterest revenues. Revenues were up $1.5 million in the employee benefit services business, and wealth management and insurance services revenue was up $0.4 million between the fourth quarter of 2019 and fourth quarter of 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On a linked quarter basis, total revenues increased $1.5 million, or 1.0%. Net interest income was up $1.5 million, or 1.6%, and noninterest revenues were consistent with the prior quarter. The increase in net interest income was driven by a $2.2 million increase due to volume, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease due to changes in interest rates. Deposit and other banking revenues increased $0.2 million, or 1.1%, on a linked-quarter basis. Employee benefit services revenue was up $0.7 million on a linked quarter basis, while wealth management and insurance services revenue was down $0.8 million. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company recorded $92.7 million in net interest income during the fourth quarter of 2019. This compares to $87.4 million of net interest income generated in the fourth quarter of 2018. Interest income on loans was up $7.2 million, or 9.8%, while interest income on investments, including cash equivalents, was up $0.4 million, or 2.3%. Interest expense on deposits increased $2.6 million between the comparable periods, while interest expense on borrowings decreased $0.3 million. The increase in interest expense on deposits was driven by a $542.6 million increase in average interest bearing deposit balances primarily due to the Kinderhook acquisition and a 10 basis point increase in the cost of deposits. The decrease in interest expense on borrowings was driven by a $64.2 million decrease in average borrowings. The net interest margin decreased six basis points, from 3.77% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 3.71% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Earning asset yields were 3.99% in both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018. However, the Company's cost of funds increased eight basis points, from 0.23% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 0.31% in the fourth quarter of 2019. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Net interest income increased $1.5 million, or 1.6%, on a linked quarter basis. The increase was attributable to a $0.6 million increase in interest income on loans, a $0.8 million increase in interest on investments and cash equivalents, including a $1.0 million Federal Reserve Bank semi-annual dividend payment, and a $0.1 million decrease in interest expense. Net interest margin decreased two basis points from 3.73% in the third quarter of 2019 to 3.71% in the fourth quarter. The yield on earning assets decreased four basis points between the linked quarters from 4.03% to 3.99%, while the total cost of funds decreased one basis point from 0.32% to 0.31%. During the fourth quarter, the Company purchased $724.1 million of investment securities, reduced cash equivalents by $738.5 million, increased average loans outstanding by $122.2 million and decreased the rates paid on certain higher-cost deposit accounts. These actions and results partially offset the unfavorable impact recent reductions in the overnight federal funds and prime lending rate had on interest income during the quarter. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company recorded a $2.9 million provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter 2019. This compares to a $2.5 million provision for loan losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2019. The Company's asset quality metrics remained stable in the fourth quarter, loans outstanding increased $37.4 million and the Company recorded net charge-offs of $2.4 million, $1.0 million less than the fourth quarter of 2018 and $0.7 million more than the linked third quarter. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $95.3 million. Excluding $0.8 million of acquisition-related expenses, the Company recorded $94.5 million of operating expenses. This compares to $87.6 million of operating expenses and no acquisition expenses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding acquisition expenses, the $6.9 million, or 7.9%, increase in recurring operating expenses was driven by a $4.4 million, or 8.5%, increase in salaries and employee benefits including an increase in medical costs, a $1.3 million, or 13.5% increase in data processing and communication costs, and a $1.7 million, or 14.0%, increase in other expenses, partially offset by a $0.4 million, or 9.4%, decrease in amortization of intangible assets and a $0.1 million, or 0.7%, decrease in occupancy and equipment expense. The overall increase in operating expenses was largely driven by higher expenses associated with expanded operations subsequent to the Kinderhook transaction including higher business development and marketing expenses. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; January 22, 2020 06:45 ET (11:45 GMT)- - 06 45 AM EST 01-22-20</P>"

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 22, 2020-- </PRE>

 Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI) today announced results for the fourth quarter of 2019: <PRE>
   -- 14 percent year-over-year growth in natural gas transport volumes in the 
      fourth quarter, the eighth consecutive quarter to exceed 10 percent 
      growth 
 
   -- $610 million or $0.27 per share of net income available to common 
      stockholders 
 
   -- $1.35 billion or $0.59 per share of distributable cash flow (DCF) 
 
   -- $785 million of excess DCF above declared dividend 
 
   -- Full-year 2019 Adjusted EBITDA up 1 percent versus 2018 despite Trans 
      Mountain sale 
 
   -- Sale of the U.S. portion of the Cochin pipeline and 70 percent interest 
      in Kinder Morgan Canada Limited (KML) to Pembina Pipeline Corporation 
      (Pembina) </PRE>

 KMI's board of directors approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share for the fourth quarter ($1.00 annualized), payable on February 18, 2020, to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 3, 2020. KMI is reporting fourth quarter net income available to common stockholders of $610 million, compared to $483 million in the fourth quarter of 2018; and DCF of $1,354 million, a 6 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2018. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The dividend we announce today represents a 25 percent increase over the fourth quarter 2018 dividend, as we continue to deliver on the dividend growth plan we outlined in mid-2017,&quot; said Richard D. Kinder, Executive Chairman. &quot;I am very bullish on our company's future. As our performance continues to indicate, the need for our assets and services has a decades-long runway. Our business segments are extremely well-positioned across our various markets.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our company had another strong quarter with earnings from our base business augmented by the two major projects placed in service during the third and fourth quarters of 2019, Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (GCX) and the Elba Liquefaction project,&quot; said Chief Executive Officer Steve Kean. &quot;We also received several approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for important natural gas projects and are executing on high-return expansion projects in each of our business units. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We maintained our commitment to fiscal discipline by funding growth capital through operating cash flows, as we have been doing since the first quarter of 2016. Demonstrating this commitment is the fact that during the year we reduced our capital expenditures by more than $300 million, which overwhelmed the slight miss on DCF. The sale of our U.S. Cochin asset, along with our 70 percent interest in KML, both at attractive valuations, helped us further strengthen our balance sheet. In fact, our net debt declined by almost $2.2 billion in the quarter and has now declined by more than $9.4 billion since the third quarter of 2015,&quot; concluded Kean. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our Natural Gas Pipelines and Product Pipelines segments generated strong commercial and financial performance in the fourth quarter,&quot; said KMI President Kim Dang. &quot;Company-wide we generated fourth quarter earnings per common share of $0.27, compared to $0.21 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted Earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2019 were up 4 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. At $0.59 per common share, DCF per share was up $0.03 from the fourth quarter of 2018, with $785 million of excess DCF above our declared dividend. In an improvement from our third quarter forecast, DCF ended the year essentially on plan at less than one-half of one percent below plan. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;KMI reported fourth quarter net income available to common stockholders of $610 million, compared to $483 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, and DCF of $1,354 million, up from $1,273 million for the comparable period in 2018. The net income and DCF increases were due to greater contributions from the Natural Gas Pipelines and Products Pipelines segments, partially offset by lower commodity prices and volumes impacting our CO(2) segment. Net income was further impacted by a $1,296 million non-cash gain associated with the KML/Cochin sale as well as $1,014 million in non-cash impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2019. These included an impairment of our investment in Ruby Pipeline driven by upcoming contract expirations and competing natural gas supplies, as well as of two of our gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma and North Texas driven by reduced drilling activity. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We also made excellent progress on our Permian Highway Pipeline project, with nearly all of the right-of-way secured along the route and construction activities well underway on the western spread. As previously announced, given the slower than anticipated pace of regulatory approvals, the project is now expected to be in service early in 2021. As with GCX, this project is critical to the development of resources and the reduction of flaring in the Permian Basin,&quot; continued Dang. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; KMI's project backlog at the end of the fourth quarter stood at $3.6 billion, approximately $500 million less than at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the CO(2) segment projects (where we have higher return thresholds than our other projects), KMI expects projects in its backlog to generate an average Project EBITDA multiple of approximately 5.7 times. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the full year of 2019, KMI reported net income available to common stockholders of $2,190 million, compared to $1,481 million in 2018, and DCF of $4,993 million, up 6 percent from $4,730 million in 2018. Net income and DCF for the full year improved year-over-year due to greater contributions from the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, lower preferred dividend payments and lower interest expense, partially offset by reduced contributions from the CO(2) segment and the Trans Mountain sale. Net income was further impacted by non-cash impairments taken during 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2020 Outlook </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For 2020, KMI's budget contemplates declared dividends of $1.25 per common share, a 25 percent increase from the 2019 declared dividends, DCF of approximately $5.1 billion ($2.24 per common share) and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $7.6 billion. KMI also expects to invest $2.4 billion in expansion projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2020. KMI expects to use internally generated cash flow to fully fund its 2020 dividend payments, as well as almost all of its 2020 discretionary spending, with no need to access equity markets. KMI also expects to end 2020 with a Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 4.3 times. More detail will be provided at our Investor Day on January 29, 2020. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; KMI does not provide budgeted net income available to common stockholders and net income, the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures of DCF and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, or budgeted metrics derived therefrom (such as the portion of net income attributable to an individual capital project, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Project EBITDA) due to the impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by GAAP such as unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview of Business Segments </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Natural Gas Pipelines segment's financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2019 was higher relative to the fourth quarter of 2018,&quot; said Dang. &quot;The segment saw higher revenue due to contributions from the Elba Liquefaction and GCX projects and various expansion projects placed in service on Tennessee Gas Pipeline (TGP).&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural gas transport volumes were up 14 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, with the largest gains on El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG), TGP and Colorado Interstate Gas (CIG), followed by Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline (KMLP), GCX and the Texas Intrastates. This constitutes the eighth quarter in a row in which volumes exceeded the previous comparable prior year period by 10 percent or more. EPNG benefited from Permian-related activity and colder California weather, TGP from new projects placed in service, CIG from increased DJ production and higher heating demand on the Front Range, KMLP from the Sabine Pass Expansion in-service, GCX from going into service, and the Texas Intrastates from the continued growth in the Texas Gulf Coast market. Natural gas gathering volumes were up 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher volumes on the South Texas, Eagle Ford and Bakken midstream systems. NGL transport volumes were up 23 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, due to higher Cochin volumes. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural gas is critical to the American economy, to meeting the world's evolving energy needs, and to cost-effectively achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Independent analysts project that U.S. natural gas demand, including net exports to Mexico and LNG exports -- displacing more carbon-intensive fuels -- will increase from 2019 levels by nearly 30 percent to more than 120 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) by 2030, which is consistent with KMI's own internal modeling. Of the natural gas consumed in or exported from the U.S., about 40 percent moves on KMI pipelines. Analysts project that future natural gas infrastructure opportunities through 2030 will be driven by LNG exports (forecast to increase more than three-fold), continued industrial development (forecast to rise by 4 Bcf/d), particularly in the petrochemical industry, net exports to Mexico (forecast to rise by 3 Bcf/d), and greater demand for gas-fired power generation across the country (forecast to increase by 2 Bcf/d). </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;During the quarter, the Products Pipelines segment benefited from strong contributions from our Bakken Crude assets, the KM Splitter, and SFPP,&quot; Dang said. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; January 22, 2020 16:05 ET (21:05 GMT)- - 04 05 PM EST 01-22-20</P>"

"<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-interest income for the current quarter was $5.1 million compared with $4.9 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $0.2 million, or 4.4%. The increase can be mostly attributed to increases of $0.2 million in Wealth Management Group (&quot;WMG&quot;) fee income, and $0.1 million in the change in fair value of equity investments. The increase in WMG fee income can be mostly attributed to an increase in fees from estates and agency accounts, and an increase in the market value of assets under management. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Interest Expense: </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-interest expense for the current quarter was $14.9 million compared with $14.2 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $0.6 million, or 4.5%. The increase can be mostly attributed to increases of $0.7 million in salaries and wages, $0.3 million in pension and other employee benefits, $0.3 million in data processing expenses, and $0.4 million in other non-interest expense, offset by decreases of $0.1 million in net occupancy expense, $0.2 million in FDIC insurance expense, $0.1 in marketing and advertising expenses, and a $0.6 million decrease in other components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits. The increase in salaries and wages can be mostly attributed to annual merit increases and a lower vacancy rate. The increase in pension and other employee benefits was due to full vesting of stock awards related to an executive retirement. The increase in other non-interest expense can be partially attributed to the impairment of a fixed asset. The increase in data processing expenses was primarily attributed to timing of various projects. The decrease in marketing and advertising expenses was due to the timing of various projects. The decrease in net occupancy expense was due primarily to the closure of two branches in 2019. The decrease in FDIC insurance expense was primarily due to the receipt of a $0.2 million credit related to the Deposit Insurance Fund's (DIF) minimum reserve ratio assessment. The decrease in other components of net periodic pension cost (benefits) was primarily due to a lump sum settlement in the fourth quarter of 2018 to terminated, vested employees. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Income Tax Expense: </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Income tax expense for the current quarter was $1.0 million compared with $0.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in income tax expense was due primarily to a tax benefit of $0.4 million recorded in December 2018 due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The effective income tax rate increased from 10.3% for the fourth quarter of 2018 to 19.1% for the fourth quarter of 2019. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4th Quarter 2019 vs 3rd Quarter 2019 </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Net Interest Income: </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Net interest income for the current quarter totaled $15.2 million compared with $15.1 million for the prior quarter, an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.4%. Interest and fees from loans decreased $0.1 million and interest and dividend income from investment securities increased $0.1 million. Interest expense on deposits decreased $0.1 million due primarily to a six basis points decrease in the average cost on savings and money market accounts. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.56% in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of seven basis points compared with 3.63% for the prior quarter. Average interest-earning assets increased $40.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, while the average yield on interest-earning assets decreased eleven basis points compared to the prior quarter. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased five basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to the prior quarter. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Interest Income: </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-interest income for the current quarter was $5.1 million compared with $5.0 million for the prior quarter, an increase of $0.1 million, or 3.0%. The increase in non-interest income can be attributed to a $0.1 million increase in interest rate swap fee income primarily due to changes in market value. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Interest Expense: </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-interest expense for the current quarter was $14.9 million compared with $13.5 million for the prior quarter, an increase of $1.4 million, or 9.8%. The increase can be mostly attributed to increases of $0.3 million in professional services, $0.2 in salaries and wage expense, $0.5 million in other non-interest expense, $0.2 million in data processing expenses, $0.1 million in net occupancy expenses, and $0.1 million in FDIC insurance expense. The increases in professional services and data processing expenses were related to the timing of various projects. The increase in salaries and wage expenses was primarily due to merit increases and a lower vacancy rate. The increase in other non-interest expense was primarily due to increases in charitable contributions, bank service fees and the impairment of a fixed asset. The increase in FDIC insurance expense was primarily due to the receipt of a credit related to the Deposit Insurance Fund's (DIF) minimum reserve ratio assessment which fully offset the expense in the third quarter of 2019, and partially offset the expense in the fourth quarter of 2019. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Income Tax Expense: </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Income tax expense for the current quarter was $1.0 million compared with $0.2 million for the prior quarter, an increase of $0.8 million. The increase in income tax expense can be attributed to a $3.1 million increase in income before income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2019, when compared to the prior quarter. The effective income tax rate increased from 8.3% for the third quarter of 2019 to 19.1% for the fourth quarter of 2019. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Asset Quality </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-performing loans totaled $18.0 million at December 31, 2019, or 1.38% of total loans, compared with $12.3 million at December 31, 2018, or 0.93% of total loans. Non-performing assets, which are comprised of non-performing loans and other real estate owned, were $18.5 million, or 1.04% of total assets, at December 31, 2019, compared with $12.8 million, or 0.73% of total assets, at December 31, 2018. The increase in non-performing loans can be mostly attributed to one commercial mortgage relationship and one participating interest in a commercial credit, offset by decreases in the non-performing residential mortgage, consumer loan, and the remaining commercial loan portfolios. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Management performs an ongoing assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based upon a number of factors including an analysis of historical loss factors, collateral evaluations, recent charge-off experience, credit quality of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and loan growth. Based on this analysis, the provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $0.3 million, an increase of $0.5 million compared with the same period in the prior year. The increase in the provision for loan losses can be mostly attributed to a $0.2 million credit adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2018. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $0.7 million, compared with $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The allowance for loan losses was $23.5 million at December 31, 2019 compared with $18.9 million at December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses was 130.38% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2019 compared with 154.59% at December 31, 2018. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.79% at December 31, 2019 compared with 1.44% at December 31, 2018. The increase in the allowance for loan losses can be mostly attributed to the aforementioned non-performing commercial mortgage relationship and participating interest in a commercial credit. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Balance Sheet Activity </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total assets were $1.788 billion at December 31, 2019 compared with $1.755 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $32.5 million, or 1.9%. The increase can be mostly attributed to increases of $41.8 million in securities available for sale, and $8.0 million in operating lease right-to-use assets related to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 Leases (&quot;Topic 842&quot;) as of January 1, 2019, offset by decreases of $7.2 million in total loans, net, $8.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $2.6 million in premises and equipment, net. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to changes in securities, loans, deposits, and borrowings, offset by year to date net income. The decrease in total loans, net, can be mostly attributed to decreases of $14.4 million in indirect consumer loans, $12.9 million in commercial mortgages, and $9.0 million in other consumer loans, offset by increases of $28.0 million in commercial and agriculture loans and $5.6 million in residential mortgages. The increase in securities available for sale can be mostly attributed to purchases in the amount of $118.1 million, offset by $33.7 million in sales of mortgage-backed and municipal securities, and $42.6 million of maturities and paydowns. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total liabilities were $1.605 billion at December 31, 2019 compared with $1.590 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $14.9 million or 0.9%. The increase in total liabilities can be mostly attributed to increases of $2.9 million in total deposits, $8.1 million in operating lease liabilities related to the January 1, 2019 adoption of Topic 842, and $4.1 million in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. The increase in deposits from $1.569 billion at December 31, 2018 to $1.572 billion at December 31, 2019 can be mostly attributed to an increase of $20.5 million in interest-bearing demand deposits and $11.0 million of time deposits, offset by decreases of $7.7 million in money market accounts and $16.2 million in non-interest bearing demand deposits. The decrease in non-interest-bearing demand deposits was mostly attributed to a decrease in personal customer deposits. The decrease in money market accounts can mostly be attributed to a decrease in ICS deposits, offset by an increase in personal customer deposits. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; January 22, 2020 17:20 ET (22:20 GMT)- - 05 20 PM EST 01-22-20</P>"

By Nicholas Jasinski </PRE>

 Comcast's latest earnings underlined the diverging fortunes of the two halves of its portfolio: a robust Xfinity cable business boosted by broadband growth, and a media business in NBCUniversal facing secular pressures. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Comcast (ticker: CMCSA) reported 79 cents in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, 3 cents ahead of analysts' consensus forecast and up 10% from the same period last year. Sales were $28.4 billion, up 2%, and slightly above the $28.2 billion that Wall Street had been expecting. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, totaled $8.4 billion -- up 3%. Net income was $3.2 billion, up 26%, while free cash flow totaled $2.5 billion -- up 20%. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Comcast stock was down 3.5% to $45.79 near midday Thursday, after the company reported its fourth-quarter 2019 and full-year results before the market opened. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Comcast added 442,000 high-speed internet customers in the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts' 378,000 forecast and up 26% from the same period in 2018. That brought its broadband subscriber growth to more than 1.4 million in 2019 -- Comcast's best in a dozen years, when the market was much less penetrated. It also lost 149,000 video subscribers, about equal to what analysts had been expecting but a major acceleration from a loss of 29,000 customers a year earlier. On the earnings call, CFO Michael Cavanagh said that the company expects video declines to increase in 2020. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That guidance dragged down stocks of other companies exposed to pay TV. Walt Disney stock (DIS) fell 1.9%, Fox Corp (FOXA) dropped 2.3%, and Discovery (DISCA) slipped 3.6%. Netflix (NFLX) stock climbed 4.9%, meanwhile. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Comcast's cable segment revenue overall increased almost 3%, to $14.8 billion, while adjusted Ebitda hit $5.9 billion, up 5%, with a percentage point wider Ebitda margin than a year earlier. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The bullish thesis there is simple. As streaming and other data-intensive internet usage becomes more and more central to Americans' lives, owning the pipe becomes more and more attractive and profitable for Comcast. And upgrading customers to faster and more expensive high-speed internet-only plans means wider profit margins that more than offset lost sales to cord-cutters who cancel TV in favor of streaming services like Netflix or Amazon.com's (AMZN) Prime Video. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the other side of the coin for Comcast is that legacy business models in its TV entertainment unit are being steadily eroded by changing technologies and consumers' preference for on-demand streaming services. Comcast will soon contribute to the shift with its recently unveiled Peacock offering, which will debut later this year. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; NBCUniversal did relatively well in the fourth quarter, with cable networks and broadcast TV revenue growth of 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively -- both better than analysts had expected. But costs rose faster than sales in cable, pushing adjusted Ebitda down 1.4%. Lower movie revenue and earnings held back the segment's overall results. NBCUniversal revenue fell 2.6% from a year earlier, to $9.2 billion, while adjusted Ebitda dropped 4.7%, to $2.0 billion. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sky results were flat year over year: Revenue rose 0.4% to $5.0 billion and adjusted Ebitda held steady at $765 million. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The contrast between Comcast's segments was evident in several analysts' remarks after the report. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Unfortunately (for investors, at least), Cable is only half of Comcast, &quot; MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett wrote. &quot;And the other half of Comcast, for which Peacock is but a welcome distraction, isn't quite as healthy.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moffett has a Neutral rating and $49 target price on Comcast shares. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Xfinity cable segment is so well positioned that it is tempting to ignore the rising pressure on NBCU, recently manifest in Peacock launch costs and reductions to consensus revenue estimates for the segment,&quot; Bernstein's Peter Supino wrote. He rates Comcast stock Market-Perform with a price target of $50. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Management raised Comcast's dividend by 10% to 92 cents for 2020. That represents a 1.9% yield, about equal to the S&amp;P 500. Cavanagh said on the call that deleveraging will be a priority in 2020, with Comcast possibly resuming share buybacks next year. Investments in Peacock content will be about $2 billion annually over the next two years. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cable-internet and TV-provider stocks have had a big run. Comcast shares have returned 38%, including dividends, over the past year through Wednesday's close. Charter Communications (CHTR) had soared 79% and Altice USA (ATUS) had jumped 56%. That compares with a 29% return for the S&amp;P 500 index. CenturyLink (CTL) stock has lagged behind, returning just over 6% in the past year. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com </P><PRE>

 &quot;Middlefield achieved record annual earnings, earnings per share, and book value for the year ended December 31, 2019, despite a more challenging banking landscape,&quot; stated Thomas G. Caldwell, President and Chief Executive Officer. &quot;During the year, we were able to successfully offset macro related pressures related to a declining rate environment and significant competition for loans and deposits, as annual noninterest income increased nearly 30%, core asset quality improved, and noninterest expenses only increased 4.5%, compared to the prior year. We continue to invest in developing new products and services for our customers, and further expanded our footprint in Central Ohio with our new Plain City branch that opened during the 2019 fourth quarter. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;During 2019, the Company repurchased 98,832 shares of our common stock, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 7.1%, and completed a two-for-one stock split to improve our trading liquidity. These actions reflect management and the board's optimism for our future and commitment to creating value for all shareholders. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;As we look to 2020 and beyond, we expect market conditions will remain competitive. During this period, our strategy will remain focused on balancing loan growth with a conservative approach to risk. In addition, we will continue to pursue strategies aimed at diversifying sources of income, expanding our presence in Central Ohio, increasing our market share in our core Northeast Ohio markets, and investing in our platform to support our long-term growth opportunity,&quot; concluded Mr. Caldwell. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Income Statement </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the 2019 full year, net interest income increased 2.3% to $41.4 million, compared to $40.4 million for the same period last year. The net interest margin for the 2019 twelve-month period was 3.68%, compared to 3.77% for the same period last year. Net interest income for the 2019 fourth quarter was $10.3 million, compared to $10.5 million for the 2018 fourth quarter. The net interest margin for the 2019 fourth quarter was 3.66%, compared to 3.76% for the same period of 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the 2019 full year, noninterest income increased 29.9% to $4.8 million, compared to $3.7 million for the same period last year. Noninterest income for the 2019 fourth quarter was $1.3 million, compared to $1.0 million for the 2018 fourth quarter. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the 2019 full year, noninterest expense increased 4.5% to $30.0 million, compared to $28.7 million last year. For the 2019 fourth quarter, noninterest expense was $7.4 million, compared to $7.2 million for the same period last year. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We have remained focused on managing risk and pricing on loans, while prudently controlling our funding costs on deposits,&quot; said Donald L. Stacy, Chief Financial Officer. &quot;During the 2019 fourth quarter charge-offs were higher as a result of charging off $566,000 of acquired student loans during the quarter. We believe this was a one-time issue, and as our nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019 indicate, we expect charge-offs will return to more historical levels during the 2020 first quarter. Looking at our deposits, I am encouraged by the growth we experienced in core deposits during the fourth quarter, and we ended the quarter with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 96.4% at December 31, 2019 compared to 97.6% at December 31, 2018.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Balance Sheet </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total assets at December 31, 2019, decreased 5.3% to $1.18 billion, from $1.25 billion at December 31, 2018. Net loans at December 31, 2019, were $977.5 million, compared to $984.7 million at December 31, 2018. The 0.7% year-over-year decrease in total net loans was a result of a 14.2% decline in consumer installment loans, and a 5.7% decline in commercial real estate loans, partially offset by an 11.5% increase in real estate construction loans, a 6.8% increase in commercial and industrial loans, and a 3.1% increase in residential real estate loans. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total deposits at December 31, 2019, were $1.02 billion, compared to $1.02 billion at December 31, 2018. The 0.5% year-over-year increase in deposits was primarily a result of higher time deposits and interest-bearing deposits. The investment portfolio, which is entirely classified as available for sale, was $105.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared with $98.3 million at December 31, 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Stockholders' Equity and Dividends </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 31, 2019, stockholders' equity increased 7.4% to $137.8 million, compared to $128.3 million at December 31, 2018.

Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019, were $8.8 million, compared to $7.8 million at December 31, 2018. Net charge-offs for the 2019 fourth quarter were $693,000, or 0.28% of average loans, annualized, compared to $276,000, or 0.11% of average loans, annualized at December 31, 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $890,000 compared to $840,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 Rollins, Inc. (NYSE: ROL), a premier global consumer and commercial services company, reported strong unaudited financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company recorded fourth quarter revenues of $506.0 million, an increase of 13.8% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $444.6 million.

Rollins' adjusted earnings per share (EPS)* removing these costs increases 2019 full year Adjusted EPS* by $0.11 to $0.73 per diluted share compared to 2018 Adjusted EPS* of $0.72 per diluted share. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eddie Northen, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Rollins, Inc. stated, &quot;We continue to invest in innovative technology as well as seeking out strong acquisitions that fit well into the Rollins family of brands.

"<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest Market Talks covering Energy markets. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0844 ET - United Utilities announcement that it was growing its dividend in line with CPIH inflation provides clarity, says Citi. The U.S. bank says that the company's materially improved package at the time of announcement of Ofwat's final determination had already reduced the risk of a dividend cut and Wednesday's announcement should remove this risk completely. The bank says the company trades at a discount to its peers as a result of concerns on the sustainability of its dividend and its limited operational outperformance in the past.

He adds OPEC's willingness to reduce production further if needed also lends price support, but cautioned there's still &quot;no sign that the virus is ending or how much more damage it will cause.&quot; Next up is EIA oil inventory data at 10:30am. A WSJ survey forecasts a 700k-bbl increase in crude, but trade group API reported Tuesday a bullish, 4.3M-bbl drop. WTI rises 0.5% to $53.77/bbl.

The company's materially improved package as Ofwat announced its final determination had already reduced the risk of a dividend cut, and this decision should remove this risk completely, the U.S. bank says.

(anthony.orunagoriainoff@dowjones.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0654 ET - The recent spike in oil prices and implied volatility in the options market has prompted energy issuers to tap the credit market after a difficult 2019, says Andrey Kuznetsov, senior credit portfolio manager at Hermes Investment Management. After this year's surge in new bond sales by companies operating in the energy industry, &quot;the sector now accounts for nearly half of all high-yield supply in developed markets year-to-date--a total of almost $8 billion,&quot; he says. The mood improved in 4Q 2019 as oil prices rose and investors took a cautious position in energy, resulting in the sector recording strong performance, Kuznetsov says. (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com; @lorena_rbal) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0612 ET - Bankruptcies among U.S. fracking-focused companies exploded in 2019 and the outlook for the sector is &quot;decidedly grim&quot; says the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. IEEFA says 42 U.S. exploration and production companies filed for bankruptcy last year, which involved nearly $26 billion in debt--double the $13 billion in bankruptcy-related debt filed in 2018. Bankruptcy filings in the oil-field services sector, which relies on the fracking industry for revenues, also doubled in 2019. The hardest hit were companies with a significant presence in the Appalachian mountains. IEEFA says more bankruptcies are expected as the gas and oil glut continues and prices remain subdued. (maitane.sardon@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0537 ET March Brent, as shown on the 30-minute chart, rebounded 0.9% yesterday. It continued to climb at the open this morning marking a high of $60.37. Currently it is off that high, but keeps trading at levels around the ascending 20-period moving average, which stands above the 50-period one. Meanwhile, the relative strength index has managed to stay above the neutrality level of 50, indicating a lack of downward momentum for Brent. A continued rebound should bring Brent toward $60.55 and $60.85 on the upside. A key support has been located at $59.75. A return to this level would show that the rebound is unsustainable, and should open a path toward $59.40 on the downside. March Brent is trading at $60.16 a barrel.

Batteries with high nickel content are becoming more popular because of the metal's stability under high temperatures but cuts to Chinese subsidies for EV purchases prompted a slump in sales of battery-driven vehicles in the world's largest car market last year. &quot;We anticipate further discounts on [nickel sulfate] in 2020,&quot; Mitchell says. &quot;It is even possible that some sulfate refiners will switch a portion of chemicals output back to metal production.&quot; (joe.wallace@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0329 ET - The coronavirus outbreak is likely to reduce entertainment and out-of-home activity in China, Credit Suisse says. Chinese hotels, department stores, restaurants and alcohol producers, as well as Macau casinos, are all expected to be negatively impacted. Meanwhile, utilities, telecom, packaged food and pharmaceuticals are likely to be more resilient, Credit Suisse adds. Investors could seek Chinese healthcare and pharma companies on a temporary and tactical basis, the bank says. E-commerce, online food delivery and online games and education could get a short-term boost as people avoid crowds, though these sectors already had a strong performance at 2019-end.

API U.S. crude inventory data reportedly showed a 4.3 million barrel drawdown versus expectations of a 1.3 million barrel drawdown and that has given prices a boost, ING notes. Still, recent price moves &quot;suggest that the market is pricing in a fairly sizeable demand impact as a result of the Wuhan virus.&quot; The big unknown for markets &quot;is for how long will travel restrictions be in place, and could these get even stricter?&quot; (David.hodari@wsj.com; @davidhodari) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (END) Dow Jones Newswires</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; January 29, 2020 08:44 ET (13:44 GMT)</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (c) 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.- - 08 44 AM EST 01-29-20</P>"

     OTHER INFORMATION (Continued) 
 
 
 
 
     Compliance with the Code on Corporate Governance 
     Practices (Continued) 
 
     Under code provision A.2.1, the role of chairman and chief           A.2.1 
 
     executive officer (&quot;CEO&quot;) should be performed by different 
 
     individuals. Since September 2005, Vong Tat Ieong David, who 
     is a director and CEO of the Company, has also carried out the 
     responsibilities of the chairman of the Company. The Board 
     considers the present structure is more suitable to the Company 
     for it can provide strong and consistent leadership and allow 
     for more efficient formulation and implementation of the 
     Company's development strategies. 
 
     Under code provision A.4.1, non-executive Directors should           A.4.1 
     be appointed for a specific term, subject to re-election. 
     The non-executive Directors of the Company, including the 
     independent non-executive Directors, are not appointed for a 
     specific term but are subject to retirement by rotation and re- 
     election at the annual general meetings of the Company at 
     least once every three years as specified in the provisions of the 
     Company's articles of association. As such, the Board considers 
     that sufficient measures have been taken to ensure that the 
     Company's corporate governance practices are no less exacting 
     than those in the CG Code. 
 
     Under code provision A.6.7, independent non-executive                A.6.7 
     directors shall attend general meetings and develop a balanced 
     understanding of the views of shareholders. There are three 
     independent non-executive Directors of the Company; they 
     were unable to attend the 2019 annual general meeting of the 
     Company held on 30 September 2019 due to their engagement 
     with their other commitments.

 Revenue grew 4.4% (or 5.5% in constant currency). Growth in Recorded Music digital and artist services and expanded-rights revenue and in Music Publishing digital and synchronization revenue was partially offset by declines in Recorded Music physical and licensing revenue and in Music Publishing performance revenue. Music Publishing mechanical revenue was flat. Revenue grew in all regions. Digital revenue grew 12.6% (or 13.5% in constant currency), and represented 56.2% of total revenue, compared to 52.1% in the prior-year quarter. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating income was $165 million compared to $147 million in the prior-year quarter. OIBDA was $236 million, up 9.8% from $215 million in the prior-year quarter and OIBDA margin increased 0.9 percentage points to 18.8% from 17.9% in the prior-year quarter. The increase in operating income, OIBDA and OIBDA margin was the result of revenue growth and lower variable compensation expense. Adjusted OIBDA rose 10.3% to $247 million and Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 1.1 percentage points to 19.7% from 18.6% due to the same factors which impacted operating income, OIBDA and OIBDA margin. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Net income was $122 million compared to $86 million in the prior-year quarter and Adjusted net income was $133 million compared to $95 million in the prior-year quarter. The improvement was due to higher operating income, gains on intercompany loans and lower tax expense associated with a benefit from the release of $33 million of the Company's U.S. deferred tax valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards in the current quarter, which were partially offset by higher other expense associated with losses on the Company's Euro-denominated debt due to changes in exchange rates in the current quarter, losses on hedging activity in the current quarter and the impact of a gain on investment in the prior-year quarter. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjusted operating income, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted net income exclude certain costs related to restructuring and other related costs in the current quarter, and certain costs related to the Company's Los Angeles office consolidation and restructuring and other related costs in the prior-year quarter. See below for calculations and reconciliations of OIBDA, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted net income. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As of December 31, 2019, the Company reported a cash balance of $462 million, total debt of $2.988 billion and net debt (defined as total long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs, minus cash and equivalents) of $2.526 billion. In December, 2019, the Company declared a cash dividend of $37.5 million, which was paid to stockholders on January 17, 2020. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cash provided by operating activities was $78 million compared to $92 million in the prior-year quarter. The change was largely a result of the timing of working capital. Free Cash Flow, defined below, was $46 million compared to a negative $146 million in the prior-year quarter due largely to the $183 million impact of the EMP acquisition in the prior-year quarter, which acquisition was entirely debt financed. Capital expenditures were $15 million, down from $26 million in the prior-year quarter due to higher spend on the Company's Los Angeles office consolidation in the prior-year quarter. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Recorded Music </P><PRE>

 Recorded Music revenue grew 4.1% (or 5.1% in constant currency). Growth in digital and artist services and expanded-rights revenue was partially offset by a decline in physical and licensing revenue. Digital revenue growth reflects the continuing growth in streaming. The increase in artist services and expanded-rights revenue was attributable to higher touring and advertising revenue. The decline in physical revenue reflects industry trends and timing of releases. The decline in licensing revenue reflects the impact of foreign exchange rates and timing. Recorded Music revenue grew in all regions. Major sellers included TWICE, Coldplay, Ed Sheeran and Lizzo. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Recorded Music operating income was $191 million, up 17.2% from $163 million in the prior-year quarter, and operating margin was up 1.9 percentage points to 17.6% versus 15.7% in the prior-year quarter. OIBDA increased 14.2% to $241 million from $211 million in the prior-year quarter, and OIBDA margin increased 1.9 percentage points to 22.2% driven by revenue growth and lower variable compensation expense. Adjusted OIBDA was $241 million versus $215 million in the prior-year quarter with Adjusted OIBDA margin up 1.5 percentage points to 22.2%. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin were driven by the same factors which impacted OIBDA and OIBDA margin. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Music Publishing </P><PRE>

 Music Publishing revenue rose 4.8% (or 6.1% in constant currency). Growth in digital and synchronization revenue more than offset a decline in performance revenue. Mechanical revenue was flat. Digital revenue growth reflects the continuing growth in streaming. Synchronization revenue growth relates to greater revenue from licensing for TV and commercials. The decline in performance revenue was driven by timing of distributions. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Music Publishing operating income was $14 million compared to $22 million in the prior-year quarter driven largely by revenue mix, timing of A&amp;R investment and higher overhead. Operating margin declined 5.2 percentage points to 8.1%. Music Publishing OIBDA decreased by $6 million or 15.4% to $33 million, and OIBDA margin declined 4.5 percentage points to 19.1% from 23.6%.

 &quot;Despite the challenging interest rate environment, we were able to post positive revenue growth, control expenses and achieve record operating income(1) of $1.3 billion in 2019,&quot; said Javier Rodríguez Soler, president and CEO of BBVA USA. &quot;While fourth quarter results were impacted by goodwill impairment caused by the decline in interest rates, this non-cash charge had no impact on our liquidity position, regulatory capital ratios, and the operations of our company or our ability to meet our customers' needs.&quot; <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the positive momentum experienced in the fourth quarter in terms of loan and deposit growth. Our digital transformation efforts also met with continued success and our mobile banking capabilities received further accolades, including recognition as an industry leader. Continuing to enhance our product offerings to meet our customers' needs while striving to deliver an amazing customer experience are key components to our plans in the year ahead.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total revenue for the quarter was $896 million, down 6 percent from fourth quarter 2018 levels primarily as a result of a 9 percent decrease in net interest income offset, in part, by a 1 percent increase in noninterest income. The percent net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 2.96 percent compared to 3.37 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full-year of 2019 total revenue (excluding securities gains) totaled $3.7 billion, up 1 percent from the prior year, as net interest income increased less than 1 percent and noninterest income (excluding securities gains) increased 5 percent. The percent net interest margin for 2019 was 3.17 percent compared to 3.30 percent for the full-year of 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Noninterest income for the quarter totaled $273 million, a 1 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full-year of 2019, noninterest income (excluding securities gains) totaled $1.1 billion, up 5 percent from the full-year of 2018. Most of our fee-based business experienced positive growth including, card and merchant processing fees (+13 percent), investment banking and advisory fees (+8 percent), money transfer income (+8 percent), service charges on deposit accounts (+6 percent), mortgage banking income (+5 percent), asset management fees (+4 percent) and investment services sales fees (+2 percent). Gains on the sales of investment securities in 2019 totaled $30 million. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining strong expense controls continued to be a key area of strength during the year. Total noninterest expense, excluding the non-cash charge, during the quarter increased a modest 2 percent compared to a year ago and for the full-year of 2019 total noninterest expense, excluding goodwill impairment, was also up a modest 2 percent. The increase in revenue and focus on expense management resulted in record operating income(1) for the year of $1.3 billion, a 3 percent increase over that obtained in the full-year of 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total loans at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 were $64.1 billion, down 2 percent from $65.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. During the second quarter of 2019, approximately $1.1 billion of commercial loans held for sale were sold. Adjusting for the sale of these loans, the year-over-year decrease in total loans was less than 1 percent. While overall loan growth in the year was muted, during the fourth quarter total loans were up 4 percent (annualized) compared to third quarter 2019 levels. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total deposits at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 were $75.0 billion, a 4 percent increase from the $72.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase of 8 percent (annualized) on a linked quarter basis. Growth in lower cost deposits outpaced overall deposit growth with interest bearing transaction accounts (savings, money market and interest bearing checking accounts) up 13 percent compared to a year ago. At the same time, noninterest bearing deposits grew 8 percent compared to a year ago, while growth on a linked quarter basis was even more robust at 16 percent (annualized).The loan to deposit ratio ended the quarter at 85.43 percent compared to 90.42 percent at the end of 2018, and the LCR was 145 percent compared to 143 percent a year ago. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans ended the quarter at 1.06 percent compared to 1.14 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2019 and 1.24 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans were 87 basis points in the quarter compared to 110 basis points in the third quarter of 2019 and 68 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full-year of 2019, net charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans was 88 basis points compared to 51 basis points for the full-year 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Provision expense in the quarter was $120 million compared to $141 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans ended the quarter at 1.44 percent compared to 1.49 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2019 and 1.36 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. The coverage ratio of nonperforming loans was 136 percent at the end of the quarter compared to 131 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2019 and 109 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total shareholder's equity at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $13.4 billion, a 1 percent decrease from $13.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. The CET1 ratio(2) stood at 12.49 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, down 40 basis points from the end of the third quarter of 2019 and up 49 basis points from the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in shareholder's equity primarily reflects dividend payments to its sole shareholder offset, in part, by an increase in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income. The decrease in the CET1 ratio(2) on a linked quarter basis primarily reflects a dividend payment during the quarter as goodwill impairment had no impact on regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; January 31, 2020 09:30 ET (14:30 GMT)- - 09 30 AM EST 01-31-20</P>"

 UniCredit SpA (UCG.MI) swung to a loss in the fourth quarter as one-offs and provisions weighed on the results and said it is considering a higher capital distribution. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The quarter ended a strategic plan the bank launched to tackle a number of issues, including a large pile of bad loans. Under the strategy, it cut costs and disposed of bad loans worth billions of euros. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The results come at time when European banks are feeling the heat from low rates: on Wednesday French bank BNP Paribas SA (BNP.FR) became the latest European lender to cut its financial targets due to the impact of ultralow interest rates. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The loss for the period was 835 million euros ($920 million), the Italian bank said Thursday. This compares with a profit of EUR1.99 billion a year earlier, when results included a significant extraordinary positive tax effect. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On an underlying basis, net profit rose 69%, it said. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenue rose 3.4% to EUR4.85 billion, boosted by fees and trading income. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysts had forecast a loss of EUR1.10 billion on revenue of EUR4.66 billion, according to a consensus forecast provided by the bank. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The results for the quarter were hit by a number of one-offs, including integration costs in Germany and Austria. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The bank said it would pay a dividend of EUR0.63 a share for 2019. It also said that it is considering an increased capital distribution to 50% for the rest of the plan. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We enjoy a solid balance sheet,&quot; Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier said. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We will consider increasing the capital distribution to 50% for FY 2020, paid in 2021, and for the remainder of the plan. As we have said before, we much prefer share buybacks over M&amp;A. This has not changed.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing a deep overhaul, which also included selling assets, the bank launched in December a new four-year plan, under which it pledged share buybacks and dividend increases, as well as cuts in jobs and costs. </P><PRE>

favourable development in the equity markets. Mandatum's unit-linked 
savings reached an all-time high as equity values appreciated 
substantially during 2019. At the same time the efforts to shrink the 
with-profit book bore fruit and the book is now almost EUR 300 million 
smaller than a year ago. 
 
   Sampo's associated company Nordea faced headwinds during the year in the 
difficult banking environment. The new management adopted revised 
financial targets in October 2019 and has already shown great 
determination to take tough decisions and work hard to develop towards 
those targets. The bank's fourth quarter 2019 results is the first 
encouraging step in this process. 
 
   As the new CEO I am looking optimistically at the coming period. Sampo 
will prosper through its underwriting focus, our in-depth knowledge 
about our markets and our strong balance sheet. I expect the operating 
environment to provide both challenges and opportunities and look 
forward to meeting these with enthusiasm and confidence.

   Group CEO and President

The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings: 
 </PRE>

 Fitch Ratings-Warsaw/London-06 February 2020: The USD200 million increase in Matador Bidco S.a.r.l.'s (BB/Positive) term loan B (TLB) facility has no impact on its rating. Funds from operations (FFO) gross adjusted proportional leverage and the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) in 2020 will be 3.4x and 3.5x, respectively, which is in line with our expectation for the rating. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The increase in debt is to partially fund the deferred purchase price agreed when The Carlyle Group purchased a 30% stake in Compania Espanola de Petroleos, S.A.U. (CEPSA; BBB-/Positive) last year, via its vehicle Matador. Carlyle has increased its stake in CEPSA to 38.5% from 30.0% since we published our rating on Matador. Matador's 'BB' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) has been derived by notching from the CEPSA opco rating based on factors such as income stream quality, dividend diversification, proportionate holdco leverage, liquidity, and dividend control and stability. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fitch considers Matador's income stream quality is in line with CEPSA's 'BBB-' IDR. We apply a one-notch reduction to reflect the structural subordination of the holdco. Proportionate CEPSA opco FFO gross leverage of 2.5x compares with proportionate holdco FFO gross leverage of 3.5x. This additional leverage results in a further notch down from CEPSA's rating. The Positive Outlook mirrors that on CEPSA. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A downgrade of CEPSA, a sustained increase in FFO gross adjusted proportional leverage to above 4.0x or decrease in dividends to holdco leading to less than 2.0x DSCR or use of the debt service reserve account would be negative for Matador's rating. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact: </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Jakub Zasada </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Director </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; - +48 22 338 6295 </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Fitch Polska SA </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Krolewska 16, 00-103 </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Warsaw </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilhelm Mjaaland </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Analyst </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; - +44 20 3530 2605 </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Media Relations: Adrian Simpson, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1010, Email: adrian.simpson@thefitchgroup.com. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional information is available on www.fitchratings.com </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

 Exxon Mobil, despite speculation to the contrary, isn't likely to cut its dividend anytime soon. If anything, the energy giant is likely to raise its quarterly payout. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; An S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 37 straight years, Exxon (ticker XOM) has come under scrutiny lately over its heavy capital spending and its ability to maintain its payout. Last year, for instance, Exxon produced $3 billion in free cash flow, less proceeds from asset sales, and spent $14.7 billion on dividend payments. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The stock, which yields a market-beating 5.7%, is reviled by some analysts amid concerns that the company is burning cash as it spends heavily on development projects that aren't expected to pay off for another few years. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Around $62 recently, the stock was in the vicinity of where it traded in September 2010 and is not far off its 10-year low. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.8 times the FactSet 2020 estimate of $3.34 a share, versus its five-year average of 19.5 times the current fiscal year's profit estimate. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this backdrop, Devin McDermott, head of North American oil and gas research at Morgan Stanley, predicted in a Feb. 3 note that Exxon Mobil &quot;does not cover its dividend organically until 2023 on our estimates and would require nearly $80 Brent to organically fund its 2020 [capital] plans.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, McDermott and several other analysts Barron's spoke with think that not only is the payout safe, but also that the company may raise it -- though perhaps not as robustly as the 6% increases in recent years. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The company typically declares a dividend increase in April, most recently to 87 cents a share from 82 cents on a quarterly basis. Observers will be keeping tabs on what the company does at that time. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the major energy firms, Exxon Mobil has by far the highest Brent oil price next year needed to cover its dividend at $81 a barrel, compared with an average of $63 for the U.S. group, according to J.P. Morgan. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, Exxon Mobil has &quot;the financial capacity today to continue to grow the dividend, even if their organic cash flows don't cover it,&quot; says Jason Gabelman, a senior equity analyst at Cowen. &quot;The dividend is not at risk.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To make sense of that, it's important to run through some basic math. A dividend is a function of earnings and cash flow, in particular free cash flow -- typically the amount of cash that's left over once a company takes care of its capital-expenditure needs. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2019, Exxon Mobil's operating cash flow totaled $33.4 billion, of which $3.7 billion came from asset sales, as the accompanying table shows. So by this calculation, which excludes those sales, the organic operating cash flow was lower at $29.7 billion. However, property, plant, equipment and other investments totaled $26.8 billion, consuming most of that cash flow and leaving about $3 billion. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to many of its peers, Exxon Mobil's dividend coverage ratio is low. Last year, Chevron's (CVX) free cash flow accounted for about 150% of the dividend it paid, compared with 44% for Exxon Mobil, according to Morgan Stanley. This year, those ratios are expected to be 162% and 40%, respectively. What's more, Exxon Mobil's debt totaled $46.9 billion as of Dec. 31, up nearly 25% from $37.8 billion a year earlier. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the surface, all of this looks troubling for Exxon Mobil, partly because it's not sustainable over the long term. At some point, piling on debt and selling assets will become untenable. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the company's debt remains manageable. Morgan Stanley estimates that Exxon Mobil's net debt accounts for about 19% of its market capitalization this year, compared with 17% last year. The estimated 2020 group average is 16%. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Exxon Mobil's CEO, Darren W. Woods, addressed some of these issues during the company's quarterly call Jan. 31. He said, in part, that &quot;multiple areas of our portfolio&quot; are at the bottom of the economic cycle. &quot;That is why we maintain a strong balance sheet, to enable us to capitalize on opportunities during the down cycle and continue to invest for long-term value and pay a reliable dividend.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Morgan Stanley's McDermott says the company &quot;has a very strong balance sheet and it also has a very a large and diversified portfolio of assets&quot; to raise cash. &quot;A mix of asset sales and taking on some additional debt will be used to sustain the dividend and fund the large capital program.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike peers such as Chevron, Exxon Mobil is spending aggressively on capital projects it hopes will begin throwing off more cash flow in the coming years. A key tenet of the bull case is that once these investments start to pay off in a few years, Exxon Mobil will be better positioned for growth than its more spending-constrained peers. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Assuming [oil] prices don't fall off the table, they should be able to recoup the operating cash flow [deficit] at that time,&quot; says Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There's one crucial caveat: If the firm's investments in oil production and other growth initiatives falter, it would be much harder to increase the dividend or even sustain it. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Write to Lawrence C. Strauss at lawrence.strauss@barrons.com </P><PRE>

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 07, 2020-- </PRE>

 HanesBrands (NYSE: HBI), a leading global marketer of branded everyday basic apparel, today announced record operating cash flow for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 and strong diluted earnings per share growth. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The company generated $803 million of net cash from operations in 2019, an increase of 25% and surpassing the high end of the company's guidance for operating cash flow expectations of $700 million to $800 million. The company significantly reduced its debt leverage by paying down $609 million of debt in 2019. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 28, 2019, net sales of $1.75 billion decreased 1% while constant-currency organic sales increased slightly. For the full year, net sales increased 2% to $6.97 billion and represented the second consecutive year of constant-currency organic sales growth. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth-quarter GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS excluding actions were each $0.51, increases of 24% and 13%, respectively. For the full year, GAAP EPS increased 11% to $1.64 and adjusted EPS excluding actions increased 5% to $1.76. (See the Note on Revisions of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements and the Note on Adjusted Measures, Rebased Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP Measures later in this news release for additional discussion and details.) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;HanesBrands delivered a solid fourth quarter right in line with our guidance and concluded a very successful year with record operating cash flow, significantly reduced debt, continued organic revenue growth, and strong underlying business fundamentals,&quot; said Hanes Chief Executive Officer Gerald W. Evans Jr. &quot;Looking forward, we expect to create meaningful shareholder value using our strong balance sheet, stabilized Innerwear profitability, and Champion, International and consumer-directed growth. We view 2020 to be an inflection point for sales, profit and EPS growth rates that accelerate down the P&amp;L.&quot; </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While the company has exited its C9 Champion business in the mass retail channel and its DKNY license for intimate apparel, the company expects continued growth in 2020 for its underlying business. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the program exits and negative currency exchange rates, the company expects net sales at the midpoint of full-year 2020 guidance to decline approximately 3%, GAAP and adjusted operating profit declines of approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, and GAAP and adjusted EPS both to be flat to a year ago. Net cash from operations is expected to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million for 2020. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When comparing the midpoint of 2020 guidance to 2019 results rebased to account for the C9 Champion and DKNY program exits, net sales would increase approximately 3%, adjusted operating profit would increase 7%, and adjusted EPS would increase 15%. (See additional guidance information in the section titled 2020 Financial Guidance later in this news release.) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Callouts for Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Results </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Strength of Champion Brand, International Segment and Consumer-Directed Business Has Driven 10 Consecutive Quarters of Constant-Currency Organic Net Sales Growth. In the fourth quarter, constant-currency organic sales increased slightly, while full-year constant-currency organic sales increased 4%. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Global Champion sales, excluding C9 Champion in the U.S. mass channel, totaled $1.9 billion in constant currency in 2019, an increase of 40% over last year as a result of expanded product offerings and increased distribution. With balanced growth in the fourth quarter, Champion sales increased 22% both domestically and internationally. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Total International constant currency organic sales increased 10% in the fourth quarter and 12% for 2019. In the quarter, sales increased in all International regions, including the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumer-directed sales, defined as all sales to consumers online or through brand stores, continue to increase and account for a larger portion of total sales. Consumer-directed sales in constant currency increased 17% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year. Consumer-directed sales in constant currency represented 30% of total sales in the quarter and 25% for the full year. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth-Quarter Operating Profit Margin Increases. The GAAP operating profit margin of 13.9% increased approximately 10 basis points, while the adjusted operating profit margin of 15.0% increased 40 basis points. Margins benefited from price increases and strong improved profitability for Innerwear intimates. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Record Operating Cash Flow, Reduced Debt, and Lower Leverage. Record operating cash flow was generated from a combination of increased GAAP net income and strong working capital management, including reduced inventory, in the fourth quarter and full year. Year-ending inventory was $150 million lower than prior year. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The company generated $803 million in net operating cash in 2019 and paid down $609 million of debt. Of that, $559 million of operating cash generation and $460 million of debt reduction occurred in the fourth quarter. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The company met its goal of reducing its debt leverage to 2.9 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which is within the company's desired long-term debt leverage range of 2 to 3 times. The company ended 2018 with debt leverage of 3.3 times. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth-Quarter 2019 Business Segment Summaries </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Constant-Currency International Segment Growth Continues. International segment sales increased 7% while operating profit decreased 2%. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 10% and operating profit increased 1%. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sales for the International segment's activewear and innerwear businesses increased more than expected. Operating profit was reduced by bankruptcy related bad-debt expense and negative foreign exchange rates on operational transactions. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Innerwear Segment Operating Profit Increases despite Lower Sales. U.S. Innerwear segment sales decreased 4% in the fourth quarter while operating profit increased 5%. Segment operating profit margin of 24.6% increased 210 basis points, benefiting from increased pricing and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sales of Innerwear basics decreased 5% as a result of earlier-than-planned disruption from ongoing store resets in the mass channel that are expected to generate increased space and share beginning in the second half of 2020. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sales of Innerwear intimates decreased 2%, which was sequentially better than the third quarter and consistent with expectations. Bra revenue increased slightly and contributed significantly to segment operating margin expansion. Successful market performance of the EasyLite and DreamWire bra innovations are contributing to revitalization efforts. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Activewear Segment Sales and Profits Affected by Program Exits, As Expected. U.S. Activewear segment fourth-quarter sales decreased 7%, slightly better than expected. Segment operating profit in the quarter decreased 8% as a result of higher SG&amp;A expenses. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Champion sales, excluding C9 Champion in the mass channel, increased more than 14% in the quarter. C9 Champion sales decreased 26% as that program continued to wind down to conclusion in January 2020. Sales in the remainder of the Activewear segment declined but performed better than expected. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular Quarterly Cash Dividend Declared and New Share Repurchase Program Authorized </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hanes Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share and approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to 40 million shares. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The regular quarterly cash dividend, which will be the 28(th) consecutive quarterly return of cash to stockholders, will be paid March 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business Feb. 18, 2020. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, the company has returned nearly $1.2 billion in cumulative quarterly cash dividends to stockholders since initiating the program in April 2013. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The new share repurchase plan authorizes the company to buy up to 40 million shares without expiration. The new plan replaces the company's previous share-repurchase authorization for 40 million shares that was approved in April 2016. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2020 Financial Guidance </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hanes has issued initial 2020 guidance for the fiscal year ending Jan. 2, 2021, which includes a 53(rd) week. Certain year-over-year comparisons reference rebased 2019 results, which adjusts for the exited C9 Champion program and DKNY license for intimate apparel. (See the Note on Adjusted Measures, Rebased Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP Measures later in this news release for additional discussion and details.) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Full-Year Guidance. The company expects 2020 net sales of $6.675 billion to $6.775 billion, GAAP operating profit of $850 million to $880 million, adjusted operating profit excluding actions of $900 million to $930 million, GAAP EPS of $1.60 to $1.68, adjusted EPS excluding actions of $1.72 to $1.80, and net cash from operations of $700 million to $800 million. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The company continues to expect growth for its underlying business on a rebased basis when isolating program exits. When comparing the midpoint of 2020 guidance to 2019 results rebased to account for the exits of the C9 Champion and DKNY programs, full-year net sales are expected to increase 3%, adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 7%, and adjusted EPS is expected to increase 15%. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; February 07, 2020 06:02 ET (11:02 GMT)- - 06 02 AM EST 02-07-20</P>"

By Andrew Bary </PRE>

 Wall Street is giving up on the energy business. Investors may want to consider getting in. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The backdrop for the hard-hit group has worsened in the past month. Fourth-quarter profits were weak, headlined by a nearly 70% drop in operating earnings at Exxon Mobil (ticker: XOM), excluding asset sales. All major areas are hurting -- energy production, refining, and chemicals. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The current quarter looks even worse. Oil prices, as measured by U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate, have slid 16% in 2020, to $51 a barrel, amid concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on Chinese demand and global economic activity. U.S. natural-gas prices are at rock-bottom levels in what is normally the strong winter heating season, at below $2 per million BTUs, down 26% in the past year. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, however, a disconnect between the U.S. stock market -- which hit records this past week as investors look beyond the coronavirus -- and the lagging energy sector. For one thing, the group offers some of the best dividend plays. The largest Western energy companies -- Exxon, Chevron (CVX), BP (BP), and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.B) -- yield 4.7% to 7.2%. The payouts look secure, with Royal Dutch carrying the majors' highest yield. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The big energy stocks are one of the most attractive areas that we see in the market,&quot; says David King, manager of the Columbia Flexible Capital Income fund (CFIAX). Investors can get a reasonable return simply from the dividends and don't need to see much appreciation in their depressed shares. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are signs of capitulation from investors. The weighting of energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index is down to a record low 3.8%, and the entire sector's value is considerably less than Apple's (AAPL) $1.4 trillion. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The group has trailed the S&amp;P 500 for seven of the past eight years and is on pace for another year of underperformance; it's down 10% in 2020, against a 3% rise in the S&amp;P. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Investors can get exposure through the Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLE), which owns the energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index. It trades at $54, after hitting a 52-week low this past week, and yields 4.3%. About 40% of its assets are in Exxon and Chevron. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A more speculative play is the SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF (XOP), which trades at $19 and yields 2% after touching a record low this past week. Its largest holdings include Apache (APA), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and EOG Resources (EOG). </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A case can be made for most of the integrated majors, as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), the largest U.S. energy and production company. King is partial to Chevron and BP. Chevron, which trades around $110, has the industry's best balance sheet, strong free cash flow, and a 4.7% yield after a recent dividend increase. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; BP, which has successfully restructured its operations since its Gulf of Mexico oil spill a decade ago, yields 6.7%. BP, whose U.S.-listed shares fetch about $37, raised its dividend slightly this past week. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; BP and Royal Dutch have lower price/earnings ratios than their U.S. peers, reflecting in part the increasing aversion to energy stocks in Europe, where investors are seeking to make a statement on climate change. ConocoPhillips, whose shares trade around $58, offers a good mix of dividends and stock repurchases. It yields 2.9%. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Exxon, at $62, is the least attractive, even after a recent drop in its shares to a 10-year low. It yields 5.6%. Unlike its peers, it is resorting to asset sales and new debt to fund its dividend. Exxon also is running counter to the rest of the industry by ratcheting up capital spending in an effort to sharply boost its daily energy production by 2025. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysts view Exxon's dividend as safe. It's a proud company that until a decade ago had the largest market value in the world. It's a good bet that it will want to extend its streak of 37 straight years of annual dividend increases by lifting the payout in April (see story, page 33). </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We still favor Chevron over Exxon,&quot; says J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh. &quot;Chevron has a strong balance sheet, a disciplined approach to capital allocation, and its break-even oil price to cover its dividend is much lower than Exxon's.&quot; While Exxon has some solid growth opportunities like Guyana, they are longer dated. Near-term earnings risk is still elevated.&quot; Gresh has an Overweight rating on Chevron, with a price target of $135, and a Neutral rating and $72 target on Exxon. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Columbia's King says Chevron's dividend yield is about double the rate on its 10-year debt -- one of the widest stock-bond yield gaps among major companies. &quot;Chevron's dividend is safe and very attractive,&quot; King says. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Granted, there have been many false dawns for the sector in recent years. Barron's has written favorably on the stocks, including a cover story in August. Yet investors probably should have some exposure to energy, and now may be a good time to get it. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com </P><PRE>

Other consists of our liquidating servicing activity from the SpringCastle Portfolio and our non-originating legacy operations, which include our liquidating real estate loans and liquidating retail sales finance receivables. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning in the fourth quarter 2019, we included Acquisitions and Servicing (&quot;A&amp;S&quot;), which was previously presented as a distinct reporting segment, in Other. A&amp;S consisted of our servicing activity from the SpringCastle Portfolio. However, due to the continued decline in servicing revenues and related expenses, management no longer views or manages the servicing activity from the SpringCastle Portfolio as a separate reportable segment. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Funding and Liquidity </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As of December 31, 2019, the company had principal debt balances outstanding of $17.5 billion, 44% of which was secured and 56% of which was unsecured.

Consumer and Insurance adjusted pretax income (loss), Consumer and Insurance adjusted net income (loss), Consumer and Insurance adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share and Other adjusted pretax income (loss) are key performance measures used by management in evaluating the performance of our business. Consumer and Insurance adjusted pretax income (loss) and Other adjusted pretax income (loss) represent income (loss) before income taxes on a Segment Accounting Basis and excludes net losses resulting from repurchases and repayments of debt, acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses, net gain on sale of cost method investment, restructuring charges, additional net gain on sale of SpringCastle interests, net loss on sale of real estate loans and non-cash incentive compensation expense related to the Fortress Transaction. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in assessing the profitability of our segment and uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our operating performance and as a performance goal under the company's executive compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, income (loss) before income taxes, net income, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Conference Call &amp; Webcast Information </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; OneMain management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss our fourth quarter 2019 results and other general matters at 8:00 am Eastern Time on Tuesday, February 11, 2020.

&quot;The maritime industry has experienced a longer period with head wind, and it is 
pleasing to see that our operating results are stronger year over year,&quot; says 
Thomas Wilhelmsen, group CEO, about 2019 results. 
 
Commenting more specifically on the fourth quarter, Wilhelmsen says: &quot;The 
positive development in sales of marine products continued into the fourth 
quarter, supported by the industry's transition to IMO2020. Income from agency 
services were stable. Ship management saw positive contribution from an 
increased fleet, but recorded costs related to offshore wind activities 
negatively impacting EBITDA.&quot; 
 
The total income for the Wilhelmsen group was USD 224 million in the quarter, up 
2% quarter on quarter. EBITDA was USD 31 million for the quarter, down 25% from 
the previous quarter, with reduced operating margin for both maritime services 
and supply services. 
 
Share of profits from associates was USD 12 million, impacted by non-operational 
items in Wallenius Wilhelmsen. Despite a 4% increase in total income, 
contribution from NorSea Group was negatively affected by adjustments in assets. 
 
Change in fair value of financial assets was negative with USD 25 million, with 
the reduced fair value of Hyundai Glovis, offsetting a positive development for 
other investments. &quot;With more than half of the group's values in listed entities 
we are sensitive to quarterly fluctuations in valuation of our financial 
investments,&quot; says Wilhelmsen. 
 
Operating profit and a net loss on investments in the fourth quarter resulted in 
a USD 2 million profit for the Wilhelmsen group after non-controlling interests. 
 
 
A total of USD 12 million (NOK 2.50 per share) where distributed to shareholders 
in form of a second dividend in November 2019. The board proposes that the 
annual general meeting approves a first dividend of NOK 3.00 per share and 
authorises the board to declare a second dividend of up to NOK 3.00 per share. 
 
With uncertainties related to global trade, including global economic growth, 
trade restrictions and the environment, the board of Wilhelmsen sees it 
necessary to be robust and retain the capacity to meet, and potentially benefit 
from, eventualities. The group has an equity ratio of 63% by the end of the 
year. 
The board expects a stable development of underlying operating performance for 
the combined group activities, but with normal seasonal variations. In short 
term, the measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus will have a negative 
impact on most business activities.

"<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest Market Talks covering Equities. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0904 GMT - Investors have few reasons to put fresh money into RELX at its current share price, Berenberg says, as the brokerage cuts the stock to hold from buy. &quot;We still love RELX as a business, but struggle to see meaningful upside from its current levels given how well the stock has performed this year. We now think there is more potential from stocks that have sold off due to coronavirus fears, and from some companies in the 'broken' category that we think could re-rate,&quot; Berenberg says. The U.K. information and analytics group delivered its 2019 results on target and is only modestly exposed to coronavirus risks, Berenberg says. Shares fall 0.7%, but are still up 18% over the last year. (adria.calatayud@dowjones.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0859 GMT - Segro's good occupational demand resulted in an increase in rental growth, led by the U.K. but with Europe showing further improvement, says Liberum. &quot;2019 NAV rose 8.9% to 708 pence and was in line with our expectations, driven by strong rental growth and development gains as well as yield compression on the continent,&quot; says the brokerage. It also notes that disposals of GBP442 million have supported the prioritization of capital toward a significant development pipeline, which &quot;remains substantially pre-let, a further sign of good demand.&quot; Liberum says that Segro trades at a justified premium, standing at around a 28% spot premium to NAV, compared to the sector at an around 6% premium. Liberum maintains its buy rating on the stock with a target price of 990 pence. (adriano.marchese@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0853 GMT - Renault's investors will question the credibility of its 2020 free cash flow guidance, Citi analysts say as shares in the auto maker drop after it reported 2019 earnings. The company said its free cash flow for 2020 should be positive excluding restructuring costs, Citi says. Given that Renault guided for its sales remaining flat and its profitability falling in 2020, this guidance assumes &quot;a significant reduction in capex which we do not believe will be sustainable should management look to [turn] group performance [around],&quot; the bank says. Renault trades 4% lower at EUR33.44. (cristina.roca@dowjones.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0851 GMT - Wirecard's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was ahead of expectations, says Bryan Garnier, adding however that the Ebitda margin for the quarter was disappointing. The German payment company posted 4Q revenue of EUR835 million, above consensus and ahead of Bryan Garnier estimates. Nevertheless, an Ebitda margin of 27.8% was disappointing given consensus expectations of 30.5%. &quot;Our belief is that part of the margin improvement not on the agenda anymore could be linked to the company reinforcing its support functions to strengthen its organization and provide more robust foundations for future growth,&quot; says Bryan Garnier. Wirecard shares trade 0.66% lower at EUR142.95. (mauro.orru@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0851 GMT - Royal Bank of Scotland has reported overall solid 2019 results, though new targets could leave investors underwhelmed, says Citigroup. Citi says underlying pretax profit excluding litigation and other one-offs of GBP1 billion was flat quarter-on-quarter and 7% above consensus. It says stronger revenues, mainly due to better other operating income, drove the beat. Costs were slightly worse while impairments were better. The results themselves are unlikely to lead to material changes to consensus earnings per share, the brokerage says. &quot;Overall solid numbers, but focus will be on the strategy update &amp; new targets, where we believe there is some risk of disappointment. We have a neutral rating,&quot; Citi analysts say. Shares fall 4.9%. (philip.waller@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0850 GMT - The FTSE 100 Index falls 0.4%, or 31.1 points to 7420.93 as corporate results from Royal Bank of Scotland Group and Astrazeneca failed to impress. RBS shares are down more than 5% after the U.K.-focused bank reported higher 4Q profit, but trimmed its medium-term returns target. Drug group Astrazeneca retreats 4.1% after fourth-quarter sales and profit fell short of expectations. Still, commercial-property developer Segro climbs 1.6% following an increase in 2019 net-asset value. NMC Health is down more than 1% after two credit-rating agencies downgraded their ratings on the troubled hospital operator and it said Executive Vice Chairman Khalifa Butti Omeir Bin Yousef had resigned. (philip.waller@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0847 GMT - Hong Kong shares ended the session higher with the benchmark Hang Seng Index rising 0.3% to close at 27815.60. The uptrend was likely supported by Beijing vowing to support the economy and a gradual resumption of production in China, KGI Securities says. Property developers led the rise, as Wharf REIC gained 2.3%, Hang Lung Properties added 2.1% and Country Garden increased 2.0%. Drug makers also climbed, with Sino Biopharm advancing 1.6% and CSPC Pharmaceutical rising 1.5%. On the down side, internet firms broadly fell, tracking Alibaba's overnight decline after its revenue growth slowed in the latest quarterly results. Alibaba's Hong Kong shares lost 1.0% and Meituan Dianping shed 1.6%. (yifan.wang@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0837 GMT - Xiaomi's dual-brand strategy could raise the Chinese smartphone maker's brand reputation and help it win over more business users, Citi says after the company launched new flagship models Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro. With Mi targeting the high-end market and Redmi targeting the budget market, Xiaomi has shown its willingness to devote resources to research and development, the bank says, adding the competitive features of the Mi 10 series show Xiaomi's strong R&amp;D capability. Citi maintains a high-risk buy call with target price unchanged at HK$13.00. Shares closed 2.1% lower at HK$13.10. (martin.mou@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0836 GMT - E-Mart may deserve a higher valuation as it seems to be trading below its historical average PE ratio, Citigroup says. The investment bank expects the South Korean retailer's convenience- and specialty-store business to provide a tailwind to its earnings growth from 2020. E-Mart has shut down loss-making specialty-stores since last year to consolidate the segment and expects its operating losses to narrow from this year. Citi raises its stock target price by 8.7% to KRW137,000 and maintains its buy rating. Shares are 2.6% lower at KRW109,500. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0832 GMT - &quot;We believe investors will be disappointed with capital return in the fourth quarter against a reduced CET1 target,&quot; Jefferies says on Royal Bank of Scotland's 2019 results. However, the U.S. bank notes that the lower dividend per share of the lender--which plans to rename itself NatWest Group--&quot;may portend greater buybacks in the near-term.&quot; Shares are down 4.9% at 217.60 pence. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0834 GMT - Wing Tai Holdings appears to have one of the lowest net gearing ratios among its peers and seems well-positioned, with scope for acquisitions worth up to S$900 million, UOB Kay Hian says. It resumes coverage of the stock with a buy rating and target price of S$2.54. The property and lifestyle company has flagged Australia and Japan as countries where it might make investments. It could also benefit from its Uniqlo JV, which has a superior brand performance and high ROEs in Singapore and Malaysia. The company's management still sees opportunities in high-end investment demand from locals, at which the company's Middle Road project is aimed, UOB notes. Wing Tai shares are down 0.5% at S$2.02. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0832 GMT - Wirecard's strong preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2019 are an indicator of the company's &quot;massive&quot; growth potential, says Hauck &amp; Aufhaeuser. The German payment company reported revenue for the fourth quarter of EUR835 million against Hauck &amp; Aufhaeuser estimates of EUR777 million and 8% above consensus estimates. &quot;Given the ongoing high customer growth in 2019 as well as the structural drivers such as the shift to cashless payments and steadily growing e-commerce, growth should remain dynamic in 2020,&quot; says Hauck &amp; Aufhaeuser. Wirecard shares trade 0.63% lower at EUR143.

"<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1646 ET - Berkshire Hathaway added new positions in Kroger, Biogen and two S&amp;P 500 ETFs in 4Q, according to a securities filing. The biggest new investment was Kroger at about $550M, while Berkshire put $192M in Biogen, $12.7M in SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust and $12.7M in Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF.

American Airlines joins rivals United and Southwest in culling the MAX from its schedule during the busiest travel period of the year, canceling MAX flying until Aug. 18. The move means canceling around 140 flights a day, but even that number understates the true effect, as the airline hasn't been scheduling as many MAX flights as it would have if had received all the new planes it had been expecting to be delivered. With the timing of regulatory approval still unclear, airlines are opting for stability during the jam-packed summer season rather than being forced into the difficult position of having to make last-minute changes if the MAX's return is delayed again. (alison.sider@wsj.com; @alyrose) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1605 ET - US stocks reach for fresh highs in the last half hour of trading in another day of small up and down moves. The S&amp;P gains 0.2% to 3380 and the Nasdaq adds 0.2% to 9731, returning to record territory. The Dow falls less than 0.1% to 29398. This leaves the Dow 1% higher for the week, the S&amp;P with a 1.6% gain and the Nasdaq up 2.2%. Kraft Heinz falls 3.2% after Fitch cuts the food maker's debt to junk. Nvidia gains 7% after posting results and guidance ahead of expectations. Expedia soars 11% on its increased earnings and revenue, even though it didn't provide guidance due to business uncertainty and the coronavirus outbreak. Ten-year Treasury yields fall back under 1.6%. Walmart and Deere report earnings next week. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1558 ET - Dealing with the needs of US infrastructure will require significant new investment, Fitch Ratings says. Any plan to address these needs will need &quot;a new paradigm to adequately address the infrastructure funding deficit,&quot; according to the ratings agency. &quot;Increased spending without a strategic, comprehensive approach to infrastructure investment based on national priorities will not go far in addressing the continued deterioration of critical economic assets,&quot; according to Fitch. Efforts to address the problem will require coordination across several levels of government, and could benefit from a non-partisan, independent commission. Absent a plan on the federal level, state and local governments have been trying to fill the funding gap, the agency says.

BlackRock's Feb. 14 public rebuke came a day after Overstock said shareholders voted to let the company move forward with the digital dividend. BlackRock's stewardship team voted against it. The money manager said Overstock didn't address concerns around how the digital security would be traded, priced and custodied. BlackRock is the world's largest investment manager with $7.4T in assets under management. &quot;Based on our analysis and multiple engagements with the company, we believe the board and management team prematurely declared this dividend and did not fully vet the trading process,&quot; BlackRock said. Overstock received a subpoena in 2019 from the SEC related to the proposed dividend, the WSJ previously reported.

Stock offerings in the country, counting both IPOs and follow-ons, could near 200B Brazilian reais ($46B) this year, almost double the level recorded in 2019, according to Duff &amp; Phelps. Already, internet-services provider Locaweb Serviços de Internet earlier this month raised BRL1.03B in the São Paulo stock exchange. San Mateo, Calif.-based Sumeru Equity Partners, which had owned a 19% stake in the Brazilian company, sold all its shares in the IPO.

BTIG downgrades CarGurus stock to neutral from buy, and Benchmark cut its price target to $42 a share from $51.

SunTrust says Nvidia has &quot;superior positioning in gaming, server acceleration / AI, &amp; (eventually) autonomous driving.&quot; The firm likes Nvidia for long-term datacenter upside, with revenue from that unit beating consensus by 17%. But watch out for capacity constraints in 2H, SunTrust says, citing supply-chain contacts who suggest Nvidia may not be able to support meaningful sequential growth from 1H to 2H. SunTrust increases its price target 3.5% to $325. Nvidia jumps 7.2% to $290.45 and has soared more than 87% over the last 12 months.

Nearly half of dealers report a higher volume of leads in 2019, with only 29% citing a decrease. Dealers plan to improve lead management in 2020, with a focus on search-engine marketing, improved website integration, more social media, better dedicated tracking systems and more attention to analytics. (chris.wack@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1308 ET - Numerous analysts are raising their price targets for Nvidia a day after the graphics-chip maker put out quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. Impressed by the company's $3.11B in sales and a strong bottom line to match, Raymond James, Bernstein Research, Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna all increase their targets. It was especially remarkable the company posted record sales of chips to data centers even before the expected launch of faster products this year, Raymond James says. The company was also able to beat expectations despite baking in $100M of potential lost revenue in its current-quarter forecasts due to the coronavirus outbreak, the note says. Nvidia gains 6.9%. (asa.fitch@wsj.com) </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1259 ET - United Airlines is the latest carrier to forgo flying its 737 MAX jets this summer. The carrier will pull the plane from its schedule until Sept. 4, and that means canceling some 7,400 flights in June, July and August. The airline says pushing the timeline back would help reduce last-minute changes for passengers amid continued uncertainty about when the MAX will be allowed to return to service. The MAX has been grounded since March after two fatal plane crashes, and airlines have had to make do without the jets they'd already had in their fleets and new deliveries they'd been counting on. Southwest Airlines said this week it wouldn't plan on flying the MAX until August. Other airlines around the world have also started planning for another peak travel season without the MAX jets.

 When specialty chemicals company Albemarle was admitted to the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats last month, it put out a press release to celebrate the announcement. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is the fanfare that can accompany admission to this club of S&amp;P 500 index companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 straight years. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But what about companies that get booted? </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are plenty of firms in this category, though not as many lately, thanks to the U.S. economy's nearly 11-year expansion. Since late 2008, 33 companies have been bumped from the Aristocrats, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, dismissal from the club isn't necessarily a death sentence. The post-Aristocrat performance of some companies is solid, as the accompanying table shows. What's more, some of the companies resumed raising dividends after their membership infraction. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The club, which recently added seven new members, includes longtime members such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Target (TGT). These companies have raised their dividends for 57, 37, and 48 years in a row, respectively. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases, dismissal from the Aristocrats occurred because the company was acquired. That was the case for health-care supplier C.R. Bard, which Becton Dickinson (BDX) bought in late 2017. Bard had been an Aristocrat for nearly 50 years. Other examples include Wrigley's, which was acquired in 2008, and Family Dollar Stores, which was bought in 2015. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In an unusual case, Eli Lilly (LLY) was bounced from the group in 2009 after it froze its dividend that year. The pharmaceutical company decided at the time that it was prudent to maintain its dividend but not increase it in order to save capital, as it faced patent expirations on key drugs such as Gemzar for cancer. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The company declared a quarterly dividend of 49 cents a share at the end of 2008, a payout it held the same for six years until late 2014, when it announced that it would boost it by a penny. It's now 74 cents a share, after a series of annual increases that started in 2014. The stock yields 2%. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another large pharmaceutical company and former Aristocrat, Pfizer (PFE), cut its dividend in half to 64 cents a share from $1.28 in 2009. That was announced when Pfizer said it was going to acquire Wyeth, another pharmaceutical firm, in a deal valued at about $68 billion. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pfizer returned to dividend increases in late 2009. Its quarterly payout at that time was raised two cents, or 12.5%, to 18 cents a share, and it has increased regularly since then -- most recently to 38 cents a share. The stock yields 4%. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilly and Pfizer aside, many companies lost their Aristocrat status amid the financial crisis a little more than a decade ago. Those companies include KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), U.S. Bancorp (USB) Bank of America (BAC), and General Electric (GE). </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; GE at the time had a large financial business called GE Capital, which blew up during the crisis. In early 2009, as GE scrambled to save capital amid a deteriorating economy, it slashed its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share from 31 cents. The dividend was subsequently increased from that level, but there have been two more cuts, most recently in late 2018, when it went to a penny a share from 12 cents. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But as the post-Aristocrats returns of most of those banks show, a dividend cut can augur solid stock performance -- notwithstanding the bad publicity surrounding being kicked out of the group. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; KeyCorp has an annual return of 11.1% since it was removed from the Aristocrats on Dec. 22, 2008, compared with 10.1% for Bank of America and 8.5% for Regions Financial. U.S. Bancorp, which lost its Aristocrat status in late 2009, has had an annual return of 11.7% since then. The S&amp;P 500's annual return is about 14%. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Companies cutting their dividends tend to dramatically underperform the broader market in the year prior to the cut announcement, as investors increasingly anticipate a payout reduction [due to] deteriorating fundamentals and cash flows,&quot; wrote Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research in a research note this past fall. But &quot;over the next two years, companies that have cut (but not eliminated) their dividends have significantly outperformed, on average,&quot; he wrote. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the case for General Electric but not for U.S. Bancorp, KeyCorp. Regions Financial and Bank of America. Over the past decade, however, all of their returns have been better except for GE's. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Elsewhere, Gannett (GCI) ended its run as an Aristocrat in 2009 after it slashed its dividend to four cents a share from 40 cents amid deteriorating advertising revenues. The newspaper publisher, which spun off its television and digital businesses in 2015, was acquired late last year by New Media Investment Group. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another ex-Aristocrat is Pitney Bowes (PBI), whose shares have done poorly since the company's exit from the club in 2013. They have had an annual return of about minus 13% since then. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, other members have fared better since leaving the Aristocrats. One, Avery Dennison (AVY), has had an annualized return of 16.7% since late 2009. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Falling out of the Aristocrats isn't fodder for a glowing press release, but it can be a sign that better stock returns over longer periods are in store. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Corrections &amp; amplifications: </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; C.R. Bard had increased its dividend for nearly 50 years before it was acquired in 2018. An earlier version of this article incorrectly cited its acquirer, Becton Dickinson. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Write to Lawrence C. Strauss at lawrence.strauss@barrons.com </P><PRE>

This well was relatively important for Tullow, as it comprises a third of the 2020 exploration budget and half the wildcat drilling program, says Peel Hunt. However, the U.K. brokerage says that the $28 million pre-drill cost may come down, as the well was drilled more quickly than expected. The disappointing failure to find either well-developed reservoir or hydrocarbon charge means that the models to target both elements need to be reworked, Peel Hunt notes.

Goldman Sachs's calculations are made using a mapping from its estimation of a 1-to-3 point drag on 1Q GDP growth, a mapping based on evidence from the SARS outbreak, a forecast based on the February Sentix survey and a statistical model that captures spillovers from China. Goldman Sachs expects the largest drag in Germany, driven by the manufacturing PMI and a slight increase in France due to the unwind of strike-related disruption.

While the coronavirus outbreak means lower foot traffic, and weaker hotel occupancy rates could weigh slightly on the developer's earnings, Nomura says Ayala's growth is still supported. It points to the company's sizeable land bank of over 12,000 hectares, a record number of project launches and strong capital expenditure.

Nomura cuts its FY 2020 earnings forecast by 2% to reflect a possible 25% reduction in Vietnam sales, and accordingly trims its target price to S$0.99 from S$1.04.

The outlook for the cargo segment is also expected to be dented by a weakening macroeconomic backdrop, the investment bank adds. Assuming the outbreak may last into June, Nomura cuts its profit forecast for FY 2020 by 11% and trims the target price to S$5.39 from S$6.10. However, the investment bank keeps its buy rating, as pent-up demand could boost the company's earnings once the outbreak clears. Shares are up 1.6% at S$4.50.

Although this year's interim earnings may fall 17%-50% on lower Chinese visitor arrivals, Resorts World Sentosa will likely stay open since it isn't fully dependent on mainland Chinese tourists, the brokerage says. It notes that a resort development project in Japan could boost cash flow by a further S$1.5 billion if secured by 4Q. The brokerage maintains its buy rating and S$0.95 target price on the stock after previously lowering the target due to the impact from the virus outbreak. Shares are up 0.6% at S$0.89.

The investment bank says petroleum charter rates have been falling since the start of the year, while news that Chinese vessels are forced to spend extra time in quarantine at sea is depressing charter rates, given that China accounts for 30% of global shipping volumes. For MISC's offshore segment, AmInvestment notes speculation is growing regarding delays in the award of projects in the region against a backdrop of lower oil prices, on concerns that global demand could be dampened by the coronavirus outbreak.

Even though the RBNZ now seems less inclined to ease monetary policy, its forecasts still assume a prolonged period of low interest rates, McIntyre said, which increases appetite for stocks with reliable cashflow and dividends.

 DGAP-News: TAKKT AG / Key word(s): Preliminary Results/Dividend 
TAKKT AG: TAKKT finishes the challenging financial year 2019 in line with 
expectations and proposes an increased dividend 
 
2020-02-19 / 07:00 
The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. 
 
*TAKKT finishes the challenging financial year 2019 in line with 
expectations and proposes an increased dividend* 
 
  · *Reported sales down 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter, organic sales 
  development declined significantly as expected by minus 7.1 percent* 
 
  · *For the full year 2019, TAKKT was able to increase sales by 2.8 percent 
  due to acquisitions and currency effects; organic minus of 1.4 percent* 
 
  · *EBITDA margin at 12.4 (12.7) percent* 
 
  · *Earnings per share at EUR 1.14 (1.34)* 
 
  · *Free TAKKT cash flow rises to EUR 107.1 (82.7) million* 
 
  · *Management Board proposes the payment of a total dividend of one euro 
  per share to the Supervisory Board* 
 
*Stuttgart, Germany, February 19, 2020.* TAKKT increased sales in the year 
under review by 2.8 percent to EUR 1,214 (1,181) million, benefiting from 
contributions of acquisitions and positive currency effects. The phase-out 
of Hubert's European activities conversely had a slight negative impact. 
Organically (i.e., adjusted for these effects), sales decreased by 1.4 
percent in comparison to the previous year. In Europe, the downturn of the 
business environment had an adverse effect on growth. In the U.S., the 
termination of a business relationship with a major Hubert customer had a 
negative impact of around 1.5 percentage points on the Group's organic 
growth, as expected. &quot;Without the loss of the major Hubert customer, we 
would have been able to report slight organic growth in 2019. In view of the 
challenging conditions, this is a result in line with expectations,&quot; says 
CEO Felix Zimmermann. 
 
The gross profit margin of 41.3 (41.5) percent remained virtually unchanged. 
EBITDA remained constant in comparison to the previous year at EUR 150.2 
(150.1) million. In the year under review, as in the previous year, it was 
influenced by one-time effects. In the previous year, TAKKT realized income 
of EUR 4.9 million from a real estate sale and an expenditure for the 
recognition of a purchase price liability of EUR 2.0 million. In the year 
under review, one-off expenses of EUR 11.2 million were incurred as a result 
of adjustments of cost structures and first steps for the new organizational 
approach TAKKT 4.0. At the same time, TAKKT generated a one-time gain of EUR 
2.8 million as a result of the income recognized from releasing an 
outstanding variable purchase price liability for XXLhoreca. 
 
In addition, the adoption of the IFRS 16 accounting standard had a positive 
impact on the EBITDA margin of around one percentage point. This was lower 
than in the previous year at 12.4 (12.7) percent. Adjusted for the 
aforementioned one-off effects in both years and for the influence of IFRS 
16, the EBITDA margin was less than one half percentage point below the 
previous year. &quot;Due to disciplined cost management, we were able to limit 
the impact of the restrained sales development on our profitability,&quot; 
explains CFO Claude Tomaszewski. 
 
Similar to the EBITDA, TAKKT cash flow of EUR 120.4 (120.8) million was 
roughly at the previous year's level. Mainly due to the release of inventory 
as opposed to a build-up in the previous year, the Group was able to 
significantly increase the free TAKKT cash flow to EUR 107.1 (82.7) million. 
Based on the business model's cash flow strength and the comparatively high 
equity ratio of 58.5 percent, the Management Board proposes the payment of a 
special dividend of EUR 0.45 in addition to the base dividend of EUR 0.55 
per share to the Supervisory Board. This would correspond to a payout ratio 
of 87.7 (63.3) percent. Even after paying a dividend of this amount, TAKKT 
would have sufficient funds for acquisitions. 
 
TAKKT expects a challenging first half of the current year. &quot;The economic 
environment is still weak. However, we expect our business to regain

"Corrected: The GDL Fund June Distribution Increases 20% to $0.12 Per Share <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Raises Annual Distribution 15% to $0.46 Per Share From $0.40 Per Share </P><PRE>
RYE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2020-- </PRE>

 The Board of Trustees of The GDL Fund (NYSE:GDL) (the &quot;Fund&quot;) declared a $0.10 per share cash distribution payable on March 24, 2020 to common shareholders of record on March 17, 2020. The Board of Trustees authorized a 20% increase in the quarterly distribution from $0.10 per share to $0.12 per share for the June 2020 distribution which increases the annual distribution 15% to $0.46 per share from $0.40 per share. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board of Trustees will continue to monitor the Fund's distribution level, taking into consideration the Fund's net asset value and the financial market environment. The distribution rate should not be considered the dividend yield or total return on an investment in the Fund. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fund makes annual distributions of its realized net long-term capital gains and quarterly cash distributions of all or a portion of its investment company taxable income to common shareholders. A portion of the distribution may be a return of capital and various factors will affect the level of the Fund's income, such as its asset mix and use of merger arbitrage strategies. To permit the Fund to maintain more stable distributions, the Fund may distribute more than the entire amount of income earned in a particular period. Because the Fund's current quarterly distributions are subject to modification by the Board of Trustees at any time and the Fund's income will fluctuate, there can be no assurance that the Fund will pay distributions at a particular rate or frequency. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Fund does not generate sufficient earnings equal to or in excess of the aggregate distributions paid by the Fund in a given year, then the amount distributed in excess of the Fund's earnings would be deemed a return of capital. Since this would be considered a return of a portion of a shareholder's original investment, it is generally not taxable and would be treated as a reduction in the shareholder's cost basis. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Short-term capital gains, qualified dividend income, ordinary income, and return of capital, if any, will be allocated on a pro-rata basis to all distributions to common shareholders for the year. Long-term capital gains, if any, are distributed in the final distribution of the year. Based on the accounting records of the Fund currently available, the current distribution paid to common shareholders in 2020 would be deemed 100% from paid-in capital on a book basis. This does not represent information for tax reporting purposes. The estimated components of each distribution are updated and provided to shareholders of record in a notice accompanying the distribution and are available on our website (www.gabelli.com). The final determination of the sources of all distributions in 2020 will be made after year end and can vary from the quarterly estimates. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the current distribution. All individual shareholders with taxable accounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for all 2020 distributions in early 2021 via Form 1099-DIV. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing. More information regarding the Fund's distribution policy and other information about the Fund is available by calling 800-GABELLI (800-422-3554) or visiting www.gabelli.com. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; About The GDL Fund </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The GDL Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company with $306 million in total net assets whose investment objective is to achieve absolute returns in various market conditions without excessive risk of capital. The Fund is managed by Gabelli Funds, LLC, a subsidiary of GAMCO Investors, Inc. (NYSE:GBL). </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; About GAMCO Investors </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; GAMCO Investors, Inc., through its subsidiaries, manages private advisory accounts (GAMCO Asset Management Inc.), mutual funds and closed-end funds (Gabelli Funds, LLC). As of December 31, 2019, GAMCO Investors had $36.5 billion in assets under management. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200219005576/en/ </P><PRE>
